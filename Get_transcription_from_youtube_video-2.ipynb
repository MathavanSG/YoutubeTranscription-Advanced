was hot but\\nyou can't ever lie to her yeah she knows\\neverything like you didn't you're like I\\ndidn't say that like not only did you\\nsay that you were wearing this yeah yeah\\nshe just knows it all yeah unbelievable\\nthat's probably a real issue in\\nrelationships you can't you can never\\nargue with her about who is right she\\nremembers it yeah 100% you're you got a\\nfoggy ass [\\xa0__\\xa0] normal human like how\\ngood's your memory my memory is not that\\ngood maybe she's an\\nelephant I don't think their memor is\\nthat good they say they are yeah but\\nlike [\\xa0__\\xa0] that you would remember too\\nright like how often do you watch one of\\nthose nature shows and you see like\\nelephants wandering around aimlessly and\\nyou know they're looking for their\\ncar cuz they can't remember where they\\nparked idiots imagine if elephants could\\ndrive that would be a real problem how\\nbig would their [\\xa0__\\xa0] car be how big\\nwould the roads have to be wow if\\nanybody else any other animals start\\ndeveloping Electronics I think we just\\nkill them yeah like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are\\nyou doing over there like we wouldn't be\\ncool with chimps fastening their own\\nweapons if they started making guns if\\nChip starts smelting iron like figuring\\nout ballistics you see chimps on the\\nRange like like hey hey hey only us yeah\\nwell isn't that what Planet of the Apes\\nis all about like similar they evolve to\\nthe point where wasn't the new one like\\nexperiments wasn't it like some kind of\\nexperiments on how it's on how it like\\npicked off like there were there were\\nnew like back in the day it was like a\\ntime machine thing like they went right\\nlike the really old ones a time machine\\nand you go forward in time and you\\nrealize like oh my God the apes are now\\nhumans and they land so far in the\\nfuture on Earth you know who wrote that\\none Rod Sterling oh did he really\\nTwilight [\\xa0__\\xa0] man he was way ahead of\\nhis time with everything genius so many\\ngood episodes you go back watch the\\nTwilight zones like go no production\\nvalue no money for special effects\\nincredible show and that's what was part\\nof their charm but the music every\\neverything worked and if you look at a\\nlot of modern-day movies they were\\npredicated on those old shows like\\nChucky there's an old episode with Telly\\nseales Taki Tina hi I'm Taki Tina and\\nI'm going to kill you this was a doll\\nremember yeah\\nfast forward to Chucky that demented\\nredheaded freckle-faced freak look at\\nthat there she is Taki Tina you know\\nwhat my favorite one was to serve man oh\\nyeah it's a\\ncookbook yeah and then Juliet child's\\nwalks out of the UFO yeah yeah hello\\neverybody we're going to serve your\\nchildren what did the aliens look like\\non to serve man it was very bizarre yeah\\nthey had giant bulbous heads there it is\\nthere it is yeah they look like Herman\\nmonster without the hair how look how\\nbad those [\\xa0__\\xa0] makeup is you can see\\nwhere it's glued to his cheek you can\\nsee everything it's so\\nshitty like you do better than that in a\\nHigh School\\nMusical speaking of human\\ncookbooks I have a buddy who just had a\\nkid and they he told me him and his wife\\nmade placenta\\nsmoothies and I'm sitting here going\\nwhat if you love them what if you love\\nthe taste your own kid and one day\\nyou're with Billy at the park and you're\\njust looking at him and you're like you\\nknow you start licking your lips like he\\nsure did taste good and then cannibalism\\nand you eat your own kid I don't I don't\\nthink it's actually eating your own kid\\nI think it's eating the nutrients that\\nprovide nourishment to the kid while\\nit's in the womb it's not you're not\\neating the kid the kid is separate from\\nthe placenta yeah the kid is an actual\\nOh I thought it was covered like you\\nknow when a when a gazelle drop drops\\nits baby on the Kalahari and it like\\nlicks all that that film off it isn't\\nthat placenta or is that just like a\\npasta\\nsauce it's like\\ncarbonara uh I think that is placenta\\nright I mean it probably must be so\\nisn't that what human kids have don't\\nthey have like Gaz it's not the kid\\nitself it's the nutrients that the kid\\nwas consuming while they were in the W I\\nbelieve obviously I'm not a doctor yeah\\nlook at this this one going to drop it\\nthey eat that she about to drop boy how\\nvulnerable are they when they're giv\\nbirth like [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah and half of those\\nkids get snatched up immediately by a\\ncat yeah some cats or wild dogs or\\nsomething come run over and steal your\\nbaby and that's it you Carri that thing\\naround inside of you for months you love\\nit more than anything in life they'll\\nprotect it like yeah like obviously they\\nhave like this insane connection with\\nthat baby and then it gets snatched away\\nby a cat it literally doesn't get its\\nfirst bleach out yeah like it it lifts\\nit set and then bong that's one of the\\nthings that people have to be very aware\\nabout in North America what bears what\\nbears are doing to deer and moose the\\nsame thing like half of the like if you\\nreally love deer and moose and Elk stuff\\nlike that half of those animals babies\\ngot eaten by bears yeah they they eat\\nlike half of the babies that come out\\nhalf half yeah like you know in a it's a\\ngood thing in a good ecosystem to call\\nthe herd yeah well it's just it's not\\neven just to call the herd it's just to\\nthat's how that's what they're there for\\nlike it's a system we we look at it like\\nit's this beautiful thing because it is\\nbeautiful you see these animals and the\\nWild and nature but what it is it's a\\nsystem it's like a mathematical system\\nyou have numbers and the amount of\\npredators is based on the amount of prey\\nand the amount of babies they have and\\nthe amount of babies that survive and\\nyou know animals that have less babies\\ndon't survive as well animals that are\\nbigger fight off the Wolves better it's\\nlike there's a whole system a whole\\nsystem and it trickles down right to the\\nvegetation and the ecosystem you know\\nthis like if they remove the Wolves then\\nthe elk and Caribou herds expand and\\nthey start eating all the growth on the\\nriver banks causing erosion the river\\nflatten now it just so so you have to\\nhave those Predators so I'm glad they're\\neating half and I'm going to if they're\\nlistening eat 3/4s if they weren't\\neating half we would be overrun by by\\ndeer and and elk and you like you you'd\\nhave a situation where you have like in\\nNew Zealand where they have to fly over\\nthe hills and just gun them down moose\\nin New Zealand in New Zealand New\\nZealand's a wild place literally but\\nit's beautiful so beautiful they got\\nthere in I get the 1700s or something\\nlike that maybe the 1800s and these\\nEuropean settlers these European\\nexplorers like this place is so\\nbeautiful but it doesn't have any things\\nfor us to kill why don't we bring in a\\nbunch of wild animals from Europe that\\nwe like to kill and so they turned it\\ninto like a wild game safari park for\\nhunting Jesu yeah so there's all these\\nanimals like Stags and all these\\ndifferent kinds of deer all these\\nanimals that are not supposed to be in\\nNew Zealand they're everywhere just\\noverwhelming like if you buy elk like if\\nyou go go to a restaurant and you buy\\nelk tenderloin most likely that elk is\\ncoming from New Zealand no yeah there's\\nelk in New Zealand a lot of elk in New\\nZealand and it's probably they probably\\nare allowed to consider stag elk too I\\ndon't think they they I don't that's a\\ngood question I don't know they're so\\nsimilar they're such a similar animal\\nthey probably taste exactly the same the\\nonly the elk have a cool sound but Stags\\nhave a really cool stag sound like a\\nlion you ever heard of stag Roar yeah\\nit's really [\\xa0__\\xa0] cool and then when\\nthey mate the the the male Elks do that\\nwhistle you know that sounds like a\\nthey're playing a a picol this\\nwhat a weird noise\\nyeah look at his penis going up and down\\noh yeah they jizz all over\\nthemselves wow well I've seen elk do it\\nwhere they just piss all over themselves\\nwhile they're screaming they're\\nscreaming Elks are even cooler give me\\nan elk an elk bugle elk bugle I think is\\nthe coolest sound the world\\noh me bro if you didn't know if you\\ndidn't know if you were in the dark and\\nyou were in the en camping and you were\\nto elk bugle and you didn't know what\\nthat was you think oh my God there's\\nmonsters out here yeah yeah there it is\\ncouldn't you imagine that being a\\nMonster\\nyeah it's sort of like an\\ninstrument imagine if it's dark out you\\nhear that you're like [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's demons\\n[Music]\\nyeah that's kind of Haunting and scary\\nthat's the greatest animal and then they\\ngo into uh the um the L the big cats go\\ninto a flemon you know this flemon I ran\\ninto problems with girlfriends cuz of\\nthis it's like when when the female\\nlions or the leopards they they get ripe\\nyou know what I mean ready to party\\nlet's go the uh the Lions and the\\ncheetahs and the they do this thing\\nwhere they smell the female scent and\\nthey\\nyou know they do this thing where they\\nthey curl their lip up yeah and it's\\nlike a sexual thing and that I I for\\nsome reason I don't know why but I do\\nthat when I'm about to get into some\\nlove making you do a little bit of that\\ndo you like embody the lion I don't know\\nI just have the thing and and and they\\nnever stick around yeah Fleming response\\ntakes place when one Lion of either sex\\nsniffs or smells the urine of another\\nchemicals and hormones contained in the\\nurine elicit the Fleming resp response\\nusually after smelling the urine patch\\non the ground or vegetation the cat is\\ndoing the smelling will lift its head\\nhis or her head and hold their lips back\\nin a strong Grimace let me see\\nit yeah and I got it's just like him\\nlook I got to start dating girls that\\nwipe I guess look at that face that\\nurine imagine looking at that right\\nbefore it [\\xa0__\\xa0] closes down on your\\nneck and go oh yeah I'm not getting out\\nof this there is [\\xa0__\\xa0] No Escape\\nthere's no hip Escape there's no\\njiujitsu move there's no there's no\\npoking to the eye that's a wrap it's a\\nwrap look at that mouth that is a wrap a\\nrapity rap I had a moment when I was on\\nSafari in Africa where it's the only\\ntime in my life I started\\nshaking we we we were on a private Land\\nRover we came up on two male lions that\\nhad just made a kill we were literally\\nprobably I'd say 25 ft from them and one\\nof them got up and we're in the open\\nLand Rover right with no no protection\\nno windows that is such [\\xa0__\\xa0] so we\\ngot the guy driving from our camp and\\nthis thing one of them got up walked\\nhalfway to us and just did that that\\nburning stare with its golden eyes oh my\\nGod and I was holding the and my hand\\ncuz it one of the few times in my life I\\nfelt like I was in death's door like\\nthat that lion could have been on me in\\n2 seconds and it was terrifying but\\nexhilarating at the same time how do\\nthey know that the Lions won't jump into\\nthe the cab and pull people out they\\nthey get acclimated to these kind of\\nclunky things and they look I believe me\\nI know Nature's unpredictable trust do\\nyou have to have well I said to our\\ndriver he was parked in front of a stump\\nI said I said to him I said dude I know\\nyou do this every day get away from the\\nstump we need to have an exit strategy\\nyeah and so he goes we'll be fine I said\\nno move from The Stomp cuz nature you\\ndon't know when Nature's going to did\\nyou know that it was going to be an open\\nair thing yeah yeah and you were cool\\nwith that yeah it's beautiful but I\\ndidn't know we were going to come up on\\ntwo male lions that were in the middle\\nof eating a\\nwilderbeast and be the only ones there\\nand like 25 ft away and one of them is\\ngoing to shorten the Distance by\\nhalf God was this before or after the\\nlady from Game of Thrones who was the\\nvideo editor she's one of the video\\neditors of Game of Thrones she got\\npulled out of a car by oh she did yeah\\nshe got K well there you go there's your\\nanswer yeah it can happen I think it was\\na different situation though I don't\\nthink they were acclimated to the open\\nair ones cuz in this one it was cars and\\nshe rolled her window down to reach out\\nto take a picture and the cat just\\nsnatched her oh idiot it's like a toy I\\nmean you you're basically rolling a\\npiece of yarn if you see if a cat sees a\\nthing that he couldn't get but now we\\ncan get it yeah they their instinct is\\njust to get it yeah like even if they\\nnever would do that if the windows would\\nroll down from the beginning the moment\\nthey see you peeking out like you're\\nbasically like\\ndangling this a video of it just a\\npicture this is how it happened yeah oh\\nGod that's so horrible man oh my god\\nlook how big that thing is Imagine That\\npulling you out of the [\\xa0__\\xa0] car oh my\\nGod so I was in Florida once and I was\\ndoing a gig like on one side of Florida\\nand had to cross over to the other\\nside and in between were you walking no\\nno no Daddy had a here's where it got\\nclunky right I

the\\nsame thing I don't know it's in the\\nBible it's one of the\\nsins what Pride yeah oh yeah it's one of\\nthe uh yeah there six like so why would\\nyou make a thing that is like I have\\nAmerican Pride I love America I do have\\nAmerican Pride I'm I'm a patriot I think\\nthis is an amazing Place yeah uh so I\\nhave pride so does that mean I'm gay or\\ndoes it mean I'm\\nsinning hm H well if it's just the verb\\nyou're just you you know what I'm saying\\nit's like what a flexible word if you\\ntrying to learn American English like\\nhow we use things like or just English\\nand you spoke another language that was\\nmore logical you'd be like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nwhy don't you have different words yeah\\nwhy do you have the same word that means\\nsuch different things like the word Rose\\nisn't there like seven different\\nmeanings for the word rose fler rose up\\nRose of corn right yeah yeah like it's\\njust like right I didn't think of rose\\nof corn yeah yeah Rose the boat yeah oh\\nmy God there's so many that's so stupid\\nwell there's two there there's RC and R\\nWS same sound did you run out of sounds\\nyeah you could didn't to make a new\\npronoun sounds every day yeah he could\\nhave called Rose of corn like clonk of\\ncorn yeah something that that doesn't\\nmake me [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nconfused especially if I'm learning the\\nlanguage like I speak Portuguese or\\nsomething like hold on my friend this is\\nthe same word\\nlike what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are you saying what a\\ngoofy you need so much context to be\\nable to like figure out I think English\\nis supposed to be one of the most\\ndifficult languages to learn I think\\nRussian's very hard Chinese is very hard\\nman very hard manity is that what you\\nsaid mandrin like Chinese oh God imagine\\nlike you can speak it but you can't read\\nit or write it CU that happens with a\\nlot of Asian languages like to to learn\\nJapanese it's like speaking Japanese is\\nhard but now you have to learn how to\\nread it and write it like that's extra\\nhard I got a story for you about that a\\nlittle later did you learn Japanese I\\nsort of well Vietnamese I sort sort of\\nhad to were you in n\\nh possibly I did two tours in n and I\\ngot to say Sunquest bus\\nlines the best tourist oh God air\\nconditioned buses V thing two tours yeah\\nright tours yeah very different meaning\\nif you're talking M Vietnam in 1967 huge\\ndifference big difference and I found\\nout um do you mind if I just dip into\\nuh I brought a little something I have\\nto do it about every 20 minutes I do\\napologize what is it I have to I have an\\neating thing I have to do really well if\\nyou don't mind no no not at all no thank\\nyou oh God what is your eating\\nthing h\\nI'm a little\\nembarrassed but\\num I have a tapeworm for real yeah like\\na it's about almost 4 feet have you ever\\nhad one you really do yeah I never know\\nwith you you know I don't know if I\\nshould feel bad or start mocking you\\nwell you can do whatever I I didn't want\\nto bring if I feel bad if it's true you\\nhave a real tape worm I do how'd you get\\nit you think I was in the Galapagos\\nIslands recently recently and uh we they\\nhave a a a rodent over there called The\\nBermuda eel rat and it's not it's not a\\ndocumented species it's the it's the\\nlocal jargon mhm everything evolves in\\nas you know through Darwin everything\\nevolved over in uh in in the Galapagos\\nthe tortoises everything it's a unique\\nplace where Evolution took place and I\\nguess this WAP became a bit elongated\\nit's spine and so they call it the came\\noff of originally off of Bermuda like uh\\ntransport ship or something\\nright and so they eat it over there and\\nI ate the damn thing and I got a\\nparasite that led to a tape worm and\\nshe's about a 4-footer what do they do\\nto get out get it out well they have uh\\npills um\\nbut this is I don't even know if I\\nshould talk about this but I was a\\nlittle odd I sort of got attached to the\\nlittle fow oh you like having it now\\nwell you know we we hear all this talk\\nabout you know women and men and men can\\nhave babies they're telling men they can\\nhave children a little baby tape for\\nthem well let's just say I have\\nsomething living inside me and I sort of\\nlike it I sort of like sometimes I can\\nfeel it moving around sometimes I'll put\\na piece of cheese in the bed at night\\nand it'll come out and if feel like I\\nhave a\\ntail and uh so what I have to do is I\\nhave\\nto I have to eat celery well what it\\ndoes it reacts to the vibration of\\nsound and celery's kind of got the best\\nkind of\\ncrunch and it kind of settles the guy\\ndown okay just I just need to take a\\ncouple of bites okay go ahead sure\\nwell if you're going to\\nlaugh you have to do this about every 20\\nminutes for the\\ntapeworm yeah settles him\\ndown I think you're going to a bad\\ndoctor I think you're getting bad advice\\nno I just mean for me for you this is\\nlike a self-medicating yeah I think they\\ncan get rid of those things man no but\\nwhat I'm saying I've grown attached to\\nDemitri probably\\nlike um you know have a forced\\nlabor but I like Demetri yeah but you\\ncan't keep a baby inside you forever the\\nwhole idea is the baby gets born and\\nthen it goes out hold on Dr Spock these\\nsuckers can grow up to 30 feet long\\nmine's a 4-footer can they really get\\nthat big how do they know how big yours\\nis would they do an MRI or\\nsomething well they did we did an\\nultrasound and they can see the tape see\\nit do you got a picture of that I don't\\nhave a picture handy how do you not have\\na picture on your phone of that my kid\\nof little Demitri yeah seems like he'd\\nbe really sad if you didn't have a\\npicture of him I got to bring one in\\nwhen I come back next week I'll bring\\none in tapeworms or cesto stesto\\ncestodes can range in length 1 meter up\\nto 50 feet 50 ft dude 15 M the length\\nand width of the tapeworms can vary\\ndepending upon\\nspecies wow um pork beef fish tape worms\\ncan grow to be 15 to 30 feet oh God and\\nBermuda eel rats yeah do they have that\\nthere how'd that rat taste you know it's\\nkind of good you know they season it up\\nwith the Galapagos seasoning and it's\\nkind of like blackened catfish but it's\\nlike Galapago seasoning so you think all\\nthose people that live there probably\\nhave tapeworms I don't know if they have\\nit but I sure got it they have to have\\nit if you got it that must mean\\neverybody has it\\nunbelievable there's uh places the world\\nthat like especially like tropical\\nplaces where most people have some kind\\nof\\nparasite it just becomes a part of like\\nyour body you're you you now exist with\\nthat thing in you\\nforever you know have you ever had a\\ntape worm no I have not you want one no\\nthanks what's the worst thing you've\\never had like the worst weird ailment\\nstaff infection no way how many people\\non your staff\\nit was a small business wow yeah wow\\nyeah just one employee what's a staff\\ninfection it's uh it's an infection that\\nyou get on your skin and uh it's like a\\nbacterial infection exactly it's really\\ncommon in Jiu-Jitsu and uh a lot of\\npeople get it and they don't recognize\\nit Ari actually had it and Ari

ground ass up here\\njust get it get in there Joseph and give\\nbirth Joseph dial it\\ndown I'm not GNA does he ever turtle on\\nyou yes does he that's why I call him\\nDimitri one night I put out a piece of\\nfeta cheese the Greek stuff and he went\\nnuts came out came out huh have you ever\\nseen a uh uh a Burmese python yes I had\\na lady friend over and I guess little\\nDmitri got jealous and she I I woke up\\nall I heard was\\nand uh I looked over he was yeah\\nunbelievable how are you\\nlaying\\nspooning like where's her face is it\\nlike right with your asses well we spoon\\nupside down so feeling it makes sense\\nshe uses her my nose like a bicycle rack\\nyou have to come\\nout yeah it's not pretty but he's my boy\\nhow long is it going to take to kill him\\nI don't want to kill him this is why I'm\\nno but for real for real how long is it\\ngoing to take to kill it well once you\\ntake those pills you can kill it like\\nwithin about 3 days and you're not\\ntaking the pills no I'm telling you guy\\nyou know I feel like I have a boy inside\\nme well wait a minute like a child okay\\nwell good luck with that thank you if\\nyou see I want to see a photo of those\\nbears the bears that have it it's so\\ndisgusting it looks like like enormous\\nspaghetti falling out their ass oh have\\nyou ever been attacked by a bear no holy\\nI'm here right from here you you look at\\nthat there are survivors and I can that\\ntapeworm coming out of his [\\xa0__\\xa0] how\\ncrazy is that wow looks like he just got\\nmarried you should put tin cans on the\\nend of those look me that's [\\xa0__\\xa0] he's\\njust hoping someone steps on it so he\\ncould pull it out of his ass yeah looks\\nlike he was parachuting and he and and\\nhe landed and he's dragging the\\nparachute I mean how insane is that wow\\nit's so I mean their whole body is just\\na disgusting mess yeah like when you eat\\nbears you eat Bear yeah I've eaten bear\\nGrizz black bear black bear black bear\\nblack bear not Griz no I've never had\\none of those what's what's why why'd you\\neat black bear well hunted them yeah\\nyeah they have to but I heard it's kind\\nof a Musky kind of weird taste no it\\nreally depends on what they've been\\neating eating but most unfortunately\\nmost of those bears are probably eating\\ncalves moose calves and and fawns deer\\nfawns they tasted good black bears are\\nkind of like goats though they'll eat\\njust about anything they eat a lot do\\nyou know that in the early days the\\nPioneers used to eat bear and they' use\\ndeer for\\nskin say again they just use deer skins\\nthey just use the the hide from Deer\\nthey were eating bear they ate bear more\\nthan they ate anything else is that\\nright yeah is that crazy well maybe\\nthere was a reason for that because the\\nbear was a threat to them so maybe it's\\nlike let's kill the thing that could\\nkill our cattle or kill our children and\\nlet's eat that versus the docile this is\\njust a theory I just came up it's a good\\ntheory that makes sense you would\\ndefinitely want to kill the thing that's\\nkilling your food and if you could eat\\nit too all the better and apparently\\nthey thought it tasted the most like\\nbeef whereas like venison is different\\nvenison has its own\\ntaste mhm yeah so they ate a lot of bear\\nblack uh black bears are dangerous but\\nGrizzles are the one you got to be\\ncareful about they're all dangerous man\\nthey're all bears I don't know if can I\\ncan I share something with you please do\\nI'm a blueberry nut like I I like I'm\\nlike blueberry when blueberry season\\nhits in early spring I'm I'm nuts about\\nit how's Demitri feel about that well he\\nlike celery don't give him Berry\\nhow dare you make fun of my boy\\nJoe anyway blueberries so uh this was\\nabout 7 years ago I'm up on a hill in B\\nout in Canada the Rocky\\nMountains Grizz you know Grizz and I'll\\nI'll use a line from Chitty Chitty Bang\\nBang remember caradus pots he was the uh\\nfather to Dick van djk and he used this\\nline where he's singing he goes uh he's\\ndoing a song and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\nand he does a line where he goes and the\\nbear came aiping over the mountain and\\nI'm sitting there picking\\nblueberries and this Behemoth comes\\nflying over the hill so that was a\\ngrizzly bear it was a Grizz and uh when\\nthey attack they roll you they roll and\\nClaw and uh I've never done this but\\nyou're such a dork\\nFu what do you\\nmean\\nwell is that a real [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\ntattoo let me see that again let me see\\nthat again dude this is not easy for me\\nto talk\\nabout the bear came a loping over the\\nmountain and uh that tattoo belongs to a\\nmechanic in Idaho and you need give it\\nback to\\nhim\\nJo let me see it again what the let me\\nsee it again the bear came a loping over\\nthe\\nmountain\\nwhat how dare you is that the longest\\nanyone's everever gone for a gag that's\\nthat is yeah that's the furthest\\nanyone's ever gone you actually got it\\ntattooed on your chest well hang on guy\\nI'm trying to tell you I got attacked by\\na\\n[Laughter]\\nGrizz you know\\n[Laughter]\\nwhat oh my\\nGod they probably be hery chewing celery\\nand you know what I did I did a thing I\\nvented it called the the uh jelly roll\\ncuz I'm in the blueberries the only way\\nto evade the Grizz I roll down the hill\\nhe's ripping my chest chest right down\\nthe hill into a river boom bouncing\\naround like Moses tuberculosis teeth you\\nmaking jelly as you roll through the\\nyeah I'm I'm crushing the yeah and this\\nbear was just befuddled just stood there\\nlooked like Forest Gump with a Chinese\\ndildo up his\\nass\\nH now mountain lion on the other hand\\ncan I share something with you\\ndoes it involve another tattoo well no\\nthe mountain\\nlion what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is that he scar did\\nyou glue those on what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is wrong\\nwith the mountain\\nlion scrapes he digs in with his\\nclaws Jes Christ what is wrong with you\\ncan a guy have adventure stories in\\nnature yeah that those that makeup\\nartist whoever did that they're like\\nfrom The Twilight Zone same person same\\nperson who did that [\\xa0__\\xa0] that alien's\\nhead it fell off hey you're healing by\\nthe power of Jesus oh\\nGod you're healing\\nhelping but here's where I talked to you\\nearlier about learning\\nMandarin here's the difference between\\nthe evolution of nature mammals fritters\\nright and human\\nbeings cut\\nto about 8 years ago I'm on the McKenzie\\nriver and there's white water like you\\nwouldn't\\nbelieve little Vietnamese boy kid named\\nKimmy long wow freckles on his face\\nunbelievable tips\\nokay Bears wild cats they just scratch\\nthe ingenuity the intelligence of a\\nhuman I jump in grab little Kimmy long\\nwow he starts scratching me can I show\\nyou\\nsomething look at\\nthis this\\nkid scratched the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of\\nme and even in a panick\\nstate I had to learn mandrin this is was\\nthe Night Before\\nChristmas well\\njeez\\nman\\nunbelievable what was his name again\\nlittle Kimmy long wow he had freckles on\\nhis face it looked like um Dolly Parton\\nserving apple cobbler if he joined them\\nhe was Vietnamese Vietnamese boy Kim be\\nlong w why would a Vietnamese kid have\\nfreckles that seems uncommon that's what\\nwas so weird that's how he stood out\\namongst all the other boys child of an\\nAmerican GI I don't know but just\\nunbelievable kid to see a little\\nVietnamese boy with freckles you don't\\nget that how many American v v like that\\nwas always a thing like those Chuck\\nNorris action movies remember like\\nmissing an action yeah there was always\\nabout guys that were still stuck over\\nthere and we had to go get them\\neverybody kind of forgot about that are\\nthose the guys that inspired you like\\nNorris oh yeah definitely yeah Bruce Lee\\nlike when you were a kid did you sneak\\ninto the movies I went to the movies and\\nthen on television too when I was a kid\\nlike the first uh Bruce Lee movie I ever\\nsaw was on television yeah I couldn't\\nbelieve it I was like look at that guy\\nthat's insane how's he doing that but\\nlike uh those missing in action movies\\nwas all about missing\\nPS and then we always us talk that was\\nalways a thing that like the PS from\\nVietnam got left behind yeah and like\\nyou know Chuck Nar is gonna go back and\\nget them and set them free and yeah how\\nmany PS got left behind in Vietnam cuz\\nthat's a that's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing man Not\\nonly was it a [\\xa0__\\xa0] War but people\\nwent over there and they left him there\\nJohn McCain remember him the Poli yeah\\nhe was a a prisoner for years he's his\\nshoulders were all [\\xa0__\\xa0] up to the he\\ncouldn't he couldn't put his arms down\\nlike he was I remember I went on a\\nroller coaster with him once and uh at\\nthe end of it I was like guy we're it's\\ndone and he was\\nstill that's how crazy Trump is Trump\\ntrump made a fun of him getting caught\\nyeah no he Trump said well I like guys\\nthat didn't get caught yeah what the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] are you saying like you were going\\nto run away you would run away would you\\nbe yeah if you're his enemy he doesn't\\ngive a [\\xa0__\\xa0] he'll say anything you're\\nskewed you are skewed even if it doesn't\\nmake any sense he'll say it like what\\nguys who don't get caught what yeah how\\ncan you [\\xa0__\\xa0] say that about a war\\nhero it's like Jesus Christ yeah that's\\ntrue it's wild crazy but he's my enemy\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] him yeah no no P's\\nbar battle mode how many American\\nsoldiers got left behind in Vietnam I\\nwas trying to find a and this is by the\\nway they're not going to tell you the\\nreal number right they're not no they\\ndidn't tell you why we're going into the\\nwar in the first place I'm sure the the\\neven the death count is probably\\ndisputed who knows have you ever\\nromanticized being in combat like that\\neven though it's the death zone have you\\never like CU you're a hunter you're\\nskilled with the uh the rifle have you\\never sort of\\nimaginary like immersed yourself into a\\nVietnamese like battle scene no no nor\\nnor could I imagine those guys who got\\nthey got conscripted you know they got\\ndrafted right so you didn't even want to\\ndo it maybe you just wanted to build\\ncars maybe you want to be a painter and\\nall of a sudden you're over there with a\\nrifle and you're you're in the dark in\\nthe jungle but does the hunter side of\\nyou go in there and imagine like you\\ncould excel in that environment no the\\nhunter is a totally different experience\\nthe hunt the hunting side of me is like\\ndipping my toe into the natural world\\nlike getting my food the hard way yeah\\nthat's the the hunter in me is going out\\nand finding food and interacting with\\nnature but the the elk are not my enemy\\nI love them right but is there a thrill\\nto the kill though there has to be a\\nmoment of sort of adrenaline and\\nJubilation when you man ERS Beast does\\nthat exist The Thrill Is that you pulled\\noff a difficult thing it's very hard to\\ndo and it's very hard to make a shot\\nwith a bow and arrow on an animal it's\\nhard in a lethal shot and to be able to\\ndo it consistently to do it every time\\nyou hunt to be able to make a lethal\\nshot and I'm talking about it like 50\\nyards 60 yards oh wow do you strictly\\nuse bow and arrow yes oh I didn't know\\nthat I thought you had rifles I shoot\\nwith rifles I I killed a pig last year\\nwith a rifle wow what the farmers\\nsausage it was a wild one they actually\\nhad to kill pretty big 200 lb Texas no\\nthis was in California and so I ate him\\njust the other day was she sag no it was\\na boy was a boy Pig no I said was she\\nsag I know what you're saying California\\nis that a joke an actor joke yeah I got\\nyou I got you what was I saying though\\nwhat was I on about well you were\\ntalking about oh the\\nhunting war war to me is insane I don't\\nknow War to me is like I don't want to\\nhave nothing nothing to do with that I\\nwould know there's no little piece of\\nyou that you're in the dark jungle\\nthat's someone's boy that's someone's\\nbaby boy I don't think of it even as a\\nman it's someone's baby boy that I don't\\nknow that guy has parents and they\\nprobably love him and he probably has a\\nwife and she loves him and he probably\\nhas friends and they love him I like it\\nthat you said that and then some [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\npolitician is telling me that that guy's\\nmy enemy I bet that guy and I if we\\ncould speak the language we'd have a\\nbeer together and have a good time he\\nprobably doesn't want to have anything\\nto do with killing me and I don't want\\nto have anything to do with killing him\\nand we're both being suckered into this\\nthing by a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] who are\\njust making money I love that answer Joe\\nif I could fly over this table and hug\\nyou I would a we hug a lot but it\\nreminds me of a movie did you ever see\\nthis old movie with Lee Marvin and I\\ncan't remember the other actor he was a\\nJapanese actor but this was a movie I\\nthink in the 60s where they're both in\\nthe war the Japanese pilot and Lee\\nMarvin they both crashed on a remote\\nisland Supreme enemies and they only had\\neach other and a box of Saki somehow got\\nstranded on the island and they became\\nthe best friends in the world and I\\nthink if everyone looked through that\\nprism in life they would forget about\\nall the war and the violence when you\\nrealize someone else is exactly like you\\nexactly and that you need someone else\\nand they have the same fears desires\\npassions and wants as you it's such a\\nbeautiful movie you know it's we're all\\nthe freaking same whenever you get into\\nan altercation with someone you feel\\ndisliked towards someone you should\\nalways just pit yourself trapped on an\\nisland with that person and go you know\\nwhat if I were alone with them I would\\nlove them they'd be my best friend you'd\\nfigure it out it's a mental thing if\\neveryone kind of adopted that mentality\\nI think we'd things would be nice things\\ncould be a lot better we're just we're\\ndivided by so many things in this world\\nwe're divided by politics we're you hear\\nlike Robert dairo screaming in front of\\npeople about Trump like horrible what\\nare you doing like what is this like\\nthis is like silly behavior all this is\\nso silly not only that labeling them\\ncalling them clowns and and denigrating\\nthem saying you're less than me because\\nI like this and you like that it's all\\ninsane do you remember the there was a\\nbeautiful experiment done by Jane\\nElliott in the\\n1960s where she took a classroom of\\nchildren and she said all the children\\nwith brown eyes raise your hands and all\\nthe children with blue eyes raise your\\nhands and she separated them and she if\\nyou can find it on YouTube she told all\\nthe blue-eyed children that they were\\nthey were beautiful they were smarter\\nthey they were they were they were more\\nSuperior than the brown-eyed children\\nand she conducted this uh experiment for\\na week and over the course of the days\\nthe blueeyed children started\\ndenigrating and looking down on the\\nbrown browney children and acting\\nSuperior and then halfway through the\\nexperiment Jane Elliott goes oh I made a\\nmistake it's the brown-eyed children\\nthat are more Superior and so the whole\\nthing shifted and all the children in\\nthat class got to feel what it was like\\nto be uh put down to uh you know have\\nracism towards them it was a fascinating\\nexperiment it's it's on YouTube if you\\never want to watch it's it's it's\\nmesmerizing it's an interesting\\nexperience but like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] lady\\nyou're playing tricks on kids well I\\nthink she was trying to Dem she I get\\nyou're demonstrating but you're also\\ntricking these kids into thinking that\\nway well I think she was setting the\\ntable for them in life saying hey maybe\\ndon't think you're better than anyone\\nwe're all the same and don't let people\\ntell you you're better than\\neveryone and and it was also a social\\nexperiment that was documented too so\\nthere was a would you let your kid do\\nthat do that kind of experiment yeah if\\nthey didn't know would you let them sign\\nup for that yeah and talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] to the\\nblue-eyed kids uh you know what i' I'd\\nlet my kid I would hope I would have\\ntold my kid a long time ago that that\\nwould be nonsense and that they wouldn't\\nbelieve that right I I would teach my\\nkid that but uh to it's one thing to\\ntell a kid something and then to let\\nsomething play out in the real world is\\nit's a different thing people humans\\nhave a tendency to get caught up in the\\nfever of things you know like\\nlike Co like like politics politics like\\nall of this stuff yeah anytime anytime\\nany sort of international conflict\\nPalestine and Israel go Ukraine and\\nRussia you have a sect of people that\\nsort of know what's what and then you\\nhave a large sect of people that just\\nget caught up in the fur of it and it's\\nit's scary to see how\\nquickly people are absorbed by it and\\nand caught up in it it's frightening\\nwell that's you ever been to a protest\\nno protests feel like like a mob it\\nfeels dangerous when there's a bunch of\\npeople walk around even if it's peaceful\\nand they're cheering especially if\\nthey're cheering about something that\\nhappened that was violent and they're\\nangry and they're demanding something\\nand they're all marching it's like you\\nthat that I think that ignites in human\\nbeings the same feelings of War yeah\\ndoes my does my cough button still\\nbusted Jamie or do you swap that out\\nokay it's going to be a pain in the ass\\nto swap\\nit we had a cough I don't think it's\\nworking there you want to try no no it's\\njust a flim well

guess\\n3ish we moved here four years ago and he\\nnever really saw lightning like very\\nrarely do you see lightning in\\nCalifornia yeah you're right or hear\\nthunder yeah\\nvery rarely do have those kind of crazy\\nstorms they have out here the storms\\nthey have out here are [\\xa0__\\xa0] wild some\\nguy posted a video yesterday Jamie on\\nInstagram of his car getting destroyed\\nby hail oh in Texas like some insane\\nlike 4 in hail chunks you see his\\nwindshield shattering his back\\nwindshield windshield got blown out\\nwhile he's driving he's like this is\\nhe's watching his car just get destroyed\\njust rocks just rocks dropping out of\\nthe sky yeah sometimes I think they\\nactually puncture right through the roof\\nlike through the metal oh yeah you got\\nto think of how far if you got a 4in\\nchunk of ice that's hurling from space\\nyeah like it's basically in the clouds\\nyeah look at that oh wow what the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\ndude that looks like JF Kennedy's car he\\nhad a convertible oh yeah he broke\\nWindows wow yeah [\\xa0__\\xa0] these cars up man\\nwhoa he's fingering it a guy it's I\\nwonder how many people get killed by\\nhail every year there's a good question\\nlook like they got what kills more staff\\nor\\nhail I don't know but I know they say\\nabout uh I think they say 12 to 30\\npeople a year this is for Real get\\nkilled by a falling coconut 150 well not\\nwhere i50 people a year 150 now yeah\\nyeah um so it's gone up we were talking\\nabout like things that kill people but\\nthey like inflate numbers like marijuana\\nkills zero coconuts falling on people's\\nhead kill 150 people we're not Outlaw\\ncoconuts yeah you know what I'm saying\\ncan you imagine getting killed by a\\ncoconut it would suck what a way to go\\nit's not good it's not a good way to go\\nespecially if you're like an\\naccomplished person yeah everything's\\ngoing great like if Steve Jobs had\\ngotten killed by a coconut or his little\\nbrother musk imagine Elon Musk is killed\\nby a coconut yeah you would no one\\nbelieve it like [\\xa0__\\xa0] CIA made that\\ncoconut yeah wild dangerous according to\\nthe NOA a oh since 2000 only four people\\nhave been killed by hail wow oh wow how\\nmany people get killed every year by\\nlightning let's guess\\n60 I'll say I don't know why I said 60\\n200 200 worldwide globally globally yeah\\nyou're probably right 20 in the US 20 in\\nthe US wow every year so what is it\\nglobally I got to figure the Chinese are\\ngetting picked off play cuz they got\\nbillions right you got the odds are and\\nthey have skyscrapers they live in skysc\\nwonder if Kimmy long Wow's going to get\\nit\\n24,000 wow 24,000 a year yeah killed by\\nlightning wow we were both way off wow\\nwhoa it was a lot less than I thought\\nwould be in\\nAmerica yeah 60 is what I thought in\\nAmerica Wow have you ever been hit by\\nlightning no but my friend Remy has h\\nRemy did he live yeah he lived he was\\nhere on the podcast a couple days ago oh\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] um he got hit by lightning I think\\nwhen he was in high school I think it\\nmade him deaf for a little bit like\\nreally [\\xa0__\\xa0] him up wow yeah he he\\ndidn't realize what happened he just\\nwoke up on the ground and they had to\\npiece it together that he got hit by\\nlightning the electronic charge going\\nthrough the\\nair have you seen what's going on right\\nnow in um where is it where there's uh\\nthese in is it Uruguay where is it where\\nthere insane uh lightning storms that\\nare coming out of that volcano oh yeah\\nhave you seen that it's a different kind\\nof lightning so it's the it's the the\\nthe particles the charged particles that\\nare being released by the lava ignites\\nwith the air somehow we'll we'll get\\nsome explain and the smoke it's a\\ndifferent kind of lightning the steam\\nthe the particles get caught in the\\nsteam the trans these insane lightning\\nshows like look at this\\nyeah Indonesia\\nIndonesia but it was it's been going on\\nlike a lot lately like even during the\\nday there's a lot of films on Tik Tock\\nand and Instagram and stuff about it bro\\nthat is so Bonkers that mean if you were\\nalive 5,000 years ago and you saw that\\nyou're like oh Satan that's where Satan\\nlives Satan's back [\\xa0__\\xa0] he's back dude I\\ngot news everybody we're [\\xa0__\\xa0] man\\nSatan's back look look at the mountain\\nSatan on the top of the mountain he's\\nthere with lightning and [\\xa0__\\xa0] like you\\nif you saw this you'd be like okay\\nthat's where Satan is 100% you would\\nthink that that's where Thor is that's\\nwhere the God of Thunder is that's where\\nbeel abub lives look at that what you\\nwould want 100% Sauron lives up there\\nthat's the eye of Sauron people don't\\nknow that lightning comes up out of the\\nground too did you know that Joe does it\\nreally yeah lightning comes people just\\nthink all lightning comes from and I'm\\nnot talking a volcano I'm talking\\nregular time so you could get it right\\nup your ass if you're in the wrong you\\nget a bolt up your ass but for real\\nhappen you imagine you get just your\\nnuts blasted by lightning poor Demitri\\nhow bad would that suck wow just be\\nwalking along the field going wow what a\\nbeautiful night Bang from the ground\\nyeah it's true right to your sack yeah\\ndo you have any pictures of\\nthat out to your\\nhead threw your balls out through your\\nhead\\nyeah just cooked\\ncooked cooked never be the same again\\ncooked what was that noise you did at\\nthe that's the the nuts like you got to\\nthink electricity is going through the\\nground in your nuts and like out the top\\nof your\\nhead just imagine your whole body like\\ncaptured by this\\nlightning it would be like stepping on a\\nlandmine but you didn't blow up you just\\nit just can look at that up out of the\\nground wow lightning trailing from\\nground to clouds in slow motion now why\\nwow that's insane it's like an etch of\\nsketch wow people don't really know\\nthese things and that's why it's\\nimportant you have me on the show like\\ntwice twice a month type of deal I'm\\nreally glad you're here for this look\\nhow cool that looks in slow motion\\nthat's what's really happening [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nthat's look at that right out of the\\nground that's as big as any lightning\\nstrike you'll see coming out of the gu\\nGod damn that's amazing yeah that looks\\na lot like Demetri I got to say all the\\nlittle branches that and this is all in\\nslow motion look how quick those little\\nbranches flicker off in the corners in\\nthe sides that looks a lot like\\nDemitri's ultrasound by the way I bet\\nyeah wow just just so we're clear\\nlightning is [\\xa0__\\xa0] cool that's one of\\nthe interesting things about living here\\nis we have these lightning storms you\\nget to watch lightning to see like\\nFlorida I think it's one of the most\\nlightning lightning active places on the\\nplanet oh yeah yeah Florida Florida is\\nlike this is hurricane season there yeah\\nlike if you're Planet trip to Florida\\nnow like hey you know you got check that\\nweather yeah but it can be stunningly\\nbeautiful though I've been in scenarios\\nwhere I've been in Florida at night and\\nyou got celery juice on me and you look\\nout like 2 three miles out and there\\nwill be active storms going on in the\\ncumulus right the degenerative molecular\\nuh charged uh transfixation particles\\nare lighting are lighting up the clouds\\nand it's like you're at a you're at a\\njudah's priest concert covered in\\nmayonnaise you got another thing\\ncoming and it's like all over do you\\nbelieve in The\\nMatrix I don't disbelieve in it because\\nif you ever want to have it I've got\\nthis uh chemically reversed uh inverse\\nmagnet magnetron camera and one of the\\nthings we associate with the Matrix is\\nwhat the numbers coming down in green so\\nif you can take a picture think of it\\nwhere does that exist in reality but if\\nyou can go out on a stormy night like\\nthat rain coming down with your\\nmagnetized nitronic reverse camera and\\ntake a picture while Lightning's\\nflashing think of it Matrix what are\\nwhat are\\nraindrops Water right right but not when\\nyou take them with an infrared matronic\\ncamera what are they then you'll see\\nnumbers in the in the see interesting if\\nyou believe in that stuff well person's\\ngot to believe in something do you\\nbelieve in it what the\\nMatrix uh I don't disbelieve in it you\\nknow I can tell you that you've\\nexperienced it in real time how can you\\ndo that a little term Joe Rogan called\\ndeja vu have you ever experienced Deja\\nVu yes so think of it how can you be in\\na place that you've never been before\\nyou're standing somewhere foreign\\nsomewhere new and all of a sudden your\\nbrain computes that you've been in this\\nexact moment and it's\\nundeniable right how how is that\\nhappening well it's not really\\nundeniable well it is undeniable because\\nyou're in it right but it's a it's\\nprobably a glitch in how you interface\\nwith reality there for glitch in The\\nMatrix well it's probably how your\\nbrain's firing your brain has just like\\nbrain is essentially just like a\\ncomputer in a way like there's a lot of\\ncalculations that are going on\\nsimultaneously a lot of sensors are\\nbeing considered different senses are\\naffecting the way you view the world and\\nI think it's very possible that you can\\nhave a situation where things just get a\\nlittle wonky for a second and you think\\nhave I done this before have I done it\\nbefore but how or or or\\nyou have done it before and every time\\nyou do this you try to do it\\nbetter and you live the same life over\\nand over and over again until you get it\\nright A lot of people believe that\\nthat's a good theory it plays into what\\nI'm going for here yeah I had a moment\\nin time where I had Deja Vu I'm not\\ngoing to say where and when cuz I don't\\nwant anyone to interfere with it but\\nI've never told anyone this before I had\\na place in time where I was walking I\\nwas going under a\\nbridge a pigeon flew out okay right a\\nchild was laughing in the\\nbackground you know like a child like he\\nyou know like a giggle a a playground\\nGiggle and a red car went by and I was\\nlike I've been here before a place I'd\\nnever\\nbeen so I documented the experience the\\ntime the place and and I've gone back to\\nthat same place for 9\\nyears to the exact same place at the\\nsame\\ntime check this out red car goes by bird\\nflies out\\npigeon kid laughing in the\\nbackground but this year something\\ndifferent happened that I'd never seen a\\nfeather fell off of the bird when it\\nflew out h so check this out you save\\nthe\\nfeather don't get ahead of\\nme well the Matrix must be real well\\nhold on I got this examined I have a lot\\nof friends in the science\\nCommunity I I know a bunch of\\nscientologists and I had them Analyze\\nThis pigeon flew out here I'm good this\\nthis is a feather from a great a you\\nknow what that is it's an extinct\\nspecies of bird from South\\nAmerica please that's okay just put it\\ndown well I think you'd like to touch it\\nnope I'm good so how does an extinct\\nspecies of bird drop a feather from a\\ncommon pigeon who knows man that's it\\nthat's the animal that's the looks like\\nthat animal didn't really have feathers\\nit did believe me and I'm holding one\\nright here W stin 3 50 years ago is that\\nwhat it was H\\nMatrix oh when from healthy to extinct\\nin 350 years they probably taste\\ndelicious they're probably stupid and\\nthey taste delicious that's what happens\\nW the great do little cutie can that\\nthing even fly no sounds like a [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nstory if the how's that feather get\\nthere well this what I'm saying this\\nthing lives near the ocean The Matrix\\nfound a feather that may someone dropped\\nit Flo off of the pigeon that for 9\\nyears Maybe not maybe it just was near\\nwhere the pigeon was and it was flying\\nthrough the air cuz someone had a a like\\nTaxidermy in their apartment building\\nand that feather just kept drifting in\\nthe and just coincidentally as the\\npigeon was passing that feather was\\nmaking its way like oh my god look what\\nfell off the pigeon an ancient extinct a\\nfeather but meanwhile it was just\\nsomeone was in an apartment building\\nwith Taxidermy of the A and they had the\\nwindow open the fan on\\ntouche you never\\nknow could could be magic though could\\nbe I like what I'm hearing do you think\\nuh this is the Matrix like if this is a\\nsimulation what does it say about your\\nchoice of like how you've chosen to\\nexist in the\\nsimulation I don't know that we have a\\nchoice you don't think so well the\\nMatrix is numbers it's mathematical so\\ndo we really have a choice did we have a\\nchoice that we were conceived did we\\nhave a choice that our we don't think we\\ndid right maybe we do or maybe it's\\ninevitable you know maybe there's just\\nthis mathematical cycle of atoms and\\nprotons and molecules interacting with\\neach other just this is the way it's\\nalways going to go it's going to go this\\nway the same way over and over and over\\nagain and the only thing different is\\nthat you get to learn from your past\\nmistakes at least some way in the\\nessence of your being and do a better\\njob of existing this next go around\\nI don't know that we have to do a better\\njob I think I don't think we have a\\nchoice I think Evolution just takes us\\nwe're just hanging on to Bears tapeworms\\nat this point you know yeah but if you\\nlive the same life over and over and\\nover again you're going to go through\\nthe same nature interaction over and\\nover again it's not going to be like a\\ndifferently evolved world you're going\\nto live the same thing over and over\\nagain like if you thought about it like\\nyou and I how old are you well I'm 56\\nhow old are you 61 are you really yeah\\nfor real yeah you look really good thank\\nyou you do you look really good ex\\nexcept the scars you're a little beat\\nup um I've been rolled by a gz we have\\ngone through one of the weirdest lives\\nyou know and if if the simulation is\\nreal and if you wanted if the simulation\\nwanted you to go through the\\nmost profound changes that human beings\\nhave ever experienced in the time of\\ntheir life just just in how people\\ninterface with the world you and I have\\ndone that yeah we we we exist we were\\nborn in a time where there was no\\ninternet and you got your news from\\ntelevision and everybody had a sort of a\\nlimited understanding of the world you\\ncould [\\xa0__\\xa0] your way through most\\nthings because nobody could Google you\\nnobody could get a book on you you\\ncouldn't just run to the library and\\nfind out if Mike was telling the truth\\nabout his War Stories you had to just\\nbelieve micro fish things everything was\\npossible the world was a different place\\nyou know then there's answering machines\\nand\\nand then the internet and that was again\\nlike a decade in between and cut to\\nsmartphones and it's been about what 15\\nyears with them now and now ai and it's\\njust like everything's happening\\nexponentially quicker I remember I was\\non news radio with uh Dave Foley in the\\n90s Dave Foy is a he's a big you know\\ncomputer internet technology nut he\\nloves that stuff yeah and at the time he\\nwas the first person I ever met who had\\na laptop okay so he had a laptop back\\nthen was a one of those Mac laptops the\\npl you know black plastic ones back in\\nthe day and he had this uh app running\\nin the background where it gave him\\nconstant news he's like look if I keep\\nit connected to the internet it\\nconstantly gives me news yeah I was like\\nwhoa you can hear your news from the\\ninternet this is crazy so it's like all\\nthe news stories of world events and so\\nwhen I look back now at how we're just\\ninundated like constantly inundated with\\nlike World conflict stories world events\\nworld problems world world environmental\\ncrisises World starvation World floods\\nlike World volcanoes with lightning like\\noh it's go you never [\\xa0__\\xa0] I I\\nremember that moment that very moment\\nwhere I was looking at Dave's laptop and\\nI was like wow the internet just going\\nto feed you the nose the news in real\\ntime you don't have to tune into the\\nnews you don't have to go buy a\\nnewspaper this was like this profound\\nmoment for me where I I still look back\\nat that day and I go that was the first\\ntime I ever saw like a baby a baby\\nsupercomputer oh look it's a little baby\\nthe news ironically you're on a show\\ncalled news radio crazy very ironically\\nvery ironically yeah wow yeah I'm\\nexcited to see where where it goes cuz I\\nI think the next the next evolution of\\nthis could be tractor beams it could be\\nparticle movers it could be you know\\nasid ridiculous as it sounds the\\ntransporter Beam on Star Trek mhm I feel\\nlike you know maybe 50 years maybe a 100\\nyears people are going to look back and\\ngo wait you went to a place called an\\nairport you got on a tube and flew 18\\nhours to Australia like I think we're\\ngoing to be at a place one day where\\nmaybe they can rearrange our molecules\\nand particles and Beam us I feel like if\\nwe can imagine it it's going to happen\\nyeah I bet it's going to happen I mean\\nthink is it funny that Star Trek figured\\nthat out but they didn't figure out\\ncomputers and they didn't figure out\\ncell phones they had walkie-talkies\\nremember KK well they they had the\\ncommunicators yeah but it was a it was a\\nwalkie-talkie SP I've got diarrhea s me\\nsome Pepto Bismol immediately but it\\nwasn't you couldn't both talk like if\\nyou and I were on a phone call what's up\\nharlon hey what's up dude it's not it's\\nlike hey Haren how are you over yeah and\\nthere was no video\\ncomponent those idiots FaceTime dumb\\nthey got to get back to the future they\\ndidn't have nothing dumb asses yeah\\nremember that yeah a twirly thing look\\nat that stupid a trip like kaleidoscope\\nand who knows what those buttons are\\neven for they're not even labeled what\\nif I find that thing on the beach I\\ndon't know what to do with it I think\\nit's an electric razor if you ask me I\\nthink it's straight [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah I\\nthink it's a garage door opener I like\\nhow it had to flip closed though I used\\nto love that about old phones when you\\ncan hang up like that I love that snap\\nshut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up [\\xa0__\\xa0] you yeah like\\nthose razor phon garage door I remember\\nI had one of those razor phones I\\nthought I was James Bond yeah you could\\nexpress yourself with them the Razor\\nphone was the [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah what did that\\none do it was just this thin little\\nbeautiful piece of metal and it didn't\\nit had terrible battery life\\nunfortunately because most phones had\\ninsane battery life back then you phone\\nwould last for days right you know\\nbecause like the phones now they just\\nhave so much electronics and this this\\nbeautiful screen and high res solution\\nit's doing things you're playing games\\non it and you know you're taking\\npictures like your battery you know but\\nstill your battery's good for like a day\\nthat was the [\\xa0__\\xa0] I had one of those I\\nthought I was in space well I also like\\nthe little side saddle did you have the\\nholster on your belt I tried that I\\ncouldn't do it I felt like such a dork\\nand this is coming from a guy who wears\\na fanny B yeah right and you and you\\nlike to play with guns you have guns I\\ndon't play with guns sir but this this\\nphone right here for me was the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] I could never imagine seeing\\nsomebody with one of those today I would\\nbe like what are you doing with that\\nthing but aren't they bringing them back\\nthey have a different one but the new\\none is like a new phone it's like a\\nmodern phone the new one folds yeah look\\nat that but it it has like apps it's\\nessentially a regular phone yeah but it\\ndoes close and it's real Slim like look\\nit looks pretty similar I think you\\nmight have to get one would you do it\\nthought about switching Android just cuz\\nI don't like being trapped in the Apple\\necosystem I don't like the idea of it\\nbut Google does a lot of like really\\nshady stuff\\nwith with uh there's there's different\\nthings they do that I don't like and one\\nof the things they do\\nis like if you look at what was their\\nmost recent\\ndeclaration they were talking about\\ncensoring things in a time of social\\nproblems remember that Jamie\\num they they reserve the right to censor\\ninformation under certain circumstances\\nads though didn't it it had something to\\ndo with Google ads\\nyeah\\num\\nthere's there's things that I don't like\\nin terms of search results curation\\nbecause that's a thing that Google does\\nthat Robert Epstein has been working on\\nfor a long time like showing that when\\nyou like say if you Google uh a\\npresidential candidate right if you\\nGoogle a candidate that's Democrat\\nyou'll get you know especially someone\\nwho they want to win you'll get like a\\nlot of positive stories that come up\\nfirst and you have to go deep if you\\nwant to find something about corruption\\nor accusations or anything like that but\\nif you do Google a republican it'll go\\nright to that now I'm not saying this is\\njust an example I'm not saying you could\\nfind that but his research shows this\\nand I'm doing a bad job of paraphrasing\\nit because I don't remember exactly what\\nit said but essentially his claim was\\nthat in curating search results you can\\nhave an impact on elections in curating\\nsearch results and putting positive\\nthings for the people that you want to\\nbe elected in the prominence of the\\nsearch result if it's not an organic\\nsearch result if you actually are\\ncurating it you can affect the way\\npeople feel about candidate and that\\nwill affect the election results okay\\nand so that's an issue that's Google\\nyeah yeah so I have an issue with that\\nand Google is Android I agree I hate\\nthat but I also have an issue with the\\nApple Walled Garden and I think there's\\na lawsuit going on right now about that\\nwhere they're they're trying to get\\npeople to um you know because of\\niMessage and you know FaceTime and all\\nthat stuff doesn't work on other phones\\noh right right right FaceTime does sort\\nof but you have to take a few steps and\\nthat's a new thing a new thing is like\\nif you FaceTime someone on an Android\\nphone they have to take a few steps to\\ndo it okay I wonder how that works I've\\nnever tried that have you ever tried\\nthat I haven't tried it let's try it\\nright now I'm going to FaceTime Brian\\nSimpson okay facetime Brian Simpson I'm\\ngoing to face time OJ Simpson yeah it\\ngives you like a link to send him or\\nsomething right okay is he still alive\\nlook at that it said I haven't seen OJ\\nSimpson it's yeah it's answering\\nquestions what thought it thought we\\nwere really asking about maybe I should\\nreach out to him is it it didn't give me\\na link to send where's the link uh I\\nthink it's up on the top like where the\\nother buttons are no hold on a second it\\ndidn't work so I have to how do I do it\\nif I want to send him a text\\nFaceTime Brian Simpson FaceTime OJ\\nSimpson okay send what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you\\npiece of [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh\\nwow went right to Herz rental car hold\\non be quiet for a second well shut the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] up well FaceTime Brian\\nSimpson okay all right I said join my\\nFaceTime all right I send it to him and\\nlet's see if it works so let's see what\\nhe has to do who's Brian Sim he's a\\nhilarious stand up comedian that is\\nperforming tonight at the comedy\\nMothership oh awesome he uh just\\nreleased a special on Netflix that's\\namazing that he filmed at the mothership\\nso it's uh it says invite\\nsent webe I should call him and tell him\\nwhat's going on who Brian\\nyeah okay this is just holding me up\\nhere it's not do hold\\non call Brian\\nSimpson all right here we\\ngo hello hey brother it's Joe I'm on a\\npodcast right now you're you're live on\\nthe podcast with Harlen Williams I we\\nwere talking about how uh Apple keeps\\npeople from being able to use certain\\nfeatures like iMessage and FaceTime and\\nI was saying that you can FaceTime\\nsomeone that has an Android phone but\\nthere's a bunch of steps they have to\\ntake I don't know how to do it so we're\\ntrying to figure out how to do it I'm\\ngoing to FaceTime you right now okay all\\nright work all right I'll FaceTime you\\nin like two seconds\\nbye cool FaceTime Brian\\nSimpson all right I sent him join my\\nFaceTime let's see how that works so\\nhere it goes we's see how this feature\\nworks now and I know all you Android\\ndorks I know that there's other [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nthat you could use to do this like\\nWhatsApp and I guess you could use\\nInstagram right don't people use\\nInstagram for video\\ncalls this is not so fluid now if I\\nwanted to FaceTime you cuz you're a\\nlittle apple Fanboy over there you're a\\nlittle boot licker hell yeah I am um I\\ncould just FaceTime you and it would\\nwork instantly see he's got this\\ninvite yeah this takes so long like it\\nruins the spontaneity about a fun\\nFaceTime call a fun FaceTime call you're\\nat a concert dude what's up look where\\nwe are and ironic initials are BS cuz\\nthis is BS this is [\\xa0__\\xa0] this is like\\nstraight [\\xa0__\\xa0] would you ever shoot\\nyour cell phone like just to get of them\\nlike with a full High powerered rifle\\nyeah we used to take them out to the\\nrange and shoot hard drives and cell\\nphones no yeah it's a good way to get\\nrid\\nstuff boom 300 wi mag at 100 yards oo\\nit's amazing what it does to a cell\\nphone ooh yeah do you line it up in a\\nscope of course yeah I can't see that\\nfar accurate 100\\nyards wow\\nyeah there's a video of it I think that\\nuh didn't Red Band have a video yeah a\\nvideo yeah you ever shot a machine gun\\nyes and Elation um it's kind of\\ninteresting it's scary it says I'm\\nwaiting to be let in a this piece of\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah forget it I'm going to tell\\nhim forget it\\nyeah wait a minute what is it doing here\\nit says join is it working\\nwaiting for others no this is horeshit\\nit doesn't\\nwork I'm telling forget it\\nbrother son of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] see but this is\\nthe thing that people are complaining\\nabout that it it forces people to think\\nyou're a fool for having an Android\\nphone so you just go out and get an\\niPhone and iPhones have dominated the\\nmarket because of that yeah so like I\\nthink the numbers are with young kids\\nthe numbers is like it's something like\\n80s something per of kids have iPhones\\nso the kids that don't have iPhones they\\nget left out of iMessage group chats\\nthey can talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] to oh you poor you\\ngot an Android phone yeah it's a class\\nthing it's a class thing it's weird it's\\na weird thing I don't like it what do\\nyou think the evolution of cell phones\\nare do you think it's like neural link\\nwhere we we're just like you know we're\\nthinking our communicative thoughts or\\nwhat's your thought on that 100% or yeah\\nthat or a wearable maybe something that\\nlike you wear and it touches your\\ntemples right cuz the concept that we're\\nwe're like this goes back to I was\\nsaying about flight like wait you guys\\ncarried these boxes around and yeah held\\nthem to your head yeah well I mean just\\nthis alone was magic a 100 years ago if\\nyou brought this 100 years back people\\nwould think you're the craziest wizard I\\nhave the answers to all questions and\\nthey would say oh my God people in 2024\\nmust be so smart he comes 2024 to like a\\nMaga convention like you see Robert\\ndairo getting yelled at he's doing his\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] press conference he'll never\\nleave like what what is this this is I\\ndon't know but this is people in 2024\\nwhereas if you gave this to people in\\n1924 they' be like there's no way\\neveryone will have the world solved once\\nthey have these oh my God then they have\\nall the information and then people will\\nknow exactly what everybody looks like\\nthere'll be no more catfishing still\\nchaos well\\nand now like there's filters that you\\ncould use where I from just a small\\nsnippet of your conversation on this\\npodcast I think they need about 30\\nseconds 30 seconds of your voice and\\nthen I could pretend to be you like just\\ntalk like this and the audience would\\nsee you with what you're wearing the way\\nyour hair is everything in your voice so\\neverything that I say like me saying\\nthis right now it would be you saying\\nthis right now your voice your face your\\nbody everything looks like you all\\nthrough AI wow so there's no [\\xa0__\\xa0] way\\nto to know what anybody is saying that's\\nnot true and then there's a big issue\\nright now with celebrities especially\\nwomen they're making porns with them oh\\nthey're they're they're um they just\\nChang superimposing like like a\\ncelebrities face swap with AI so this\\nporn star is having sex with this person\\nyou face swap Natalie Portman or [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nAngelina Jolie and now you have a a real\\nrealistic looking sex tape of famous\\npeople getting [\\xa0__\\xa0] so I could see\\nJudge Judy plowing the piz boy just\\nsucking [\\xa0__\\xa0] like it's going out of\\nstyle the closing sale wow imagine\\nimagine

my life\\nthat's a one time deal right it's hard\\ntricker into doing that again\\nwell some women like\\nAdventure yeah what's the weirdest place\\nyou've ever uh done it your house that\\nwas\\nyou wow thought I heard that dog\\ngrowling under the bed\\nyeah I was doing it under the bed while\\nyou were on top of the bed to sleep okay\\npre-marriage cuz I don't want to get you\\nin trouble where was the wildest place\\nwe were only 15 remember yeah where'd\\nyou do it wildest place I guess in the\\nwoods when we were kids there was\\nnowhere to go so you go in the woods one\\ntime we got eaten up by mosquitoes like\\nour whole body both of our bodies just\\ncovered in mosquitoes we're so [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nwe got naked in the woods yeah in July\\nin Massachusetts wow yeah but you're\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] 17 you don't know what the hell\\nyou're doing you're crazy yeah wild kids\\na lot in the woods yeah well there was\\nalways Woods were always there yeah\\nthere was a place when you were kids you\\ncould just go to the woods you know just\\nbring a towel or a blanket or something\\nyou love to the woods yeah but the woods\\nare scary cuz anything in the woods is\\nscary things in the woods become scary\\neven if they're not scary anywhere else\\nlike a baby a naked baby in the woods\\njust staring at you it's [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nterrifying there's no other place where\\na naked baby is scary like a if you're\\nwalking down the street you see a naked\\nbaby like oh my God whose baby is this\\ndoes anybody know whose baby hey little\\nguy hold on and then you call the police\\nyou pick up the baby in the woods you're\\nlike we're going to die it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nnaked baby just staring at us if it's\\nhanging upside down from a you know a\\nred pine staring at you that's pretty\\ncreepy yeah Holding On by its feet yeah\\nlike a bat if you saw a baby in the\\nwoods just staring at you'd be [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nterrified any other place baby so the\\nwoods are automatically scared\\nand you're scared that you're going to\\nget caught so that's exting we going to\\nget caught we're not going to get caught\\ndon't worry we're going to go deep in\\nthe woods what about in the city though\\nyou ever do it in a crazy place in the\\ncity no not really you sewers you ever\\ngo in the sewer you ever go in a manhole\\nhow a little fun on a ferris wheel once\\nreally yeah W yeah you worried you were\\ngoing to be at the bottom and wouldn't\\nbe able well that was was cool we we\\nwould we would time it so that when we\\nwhen we came down it was like hand off\\nand then we'd swirl so it was like kind\\nof this really fun sort of start and\\nstop thing and then one time I'm not\\nkidding the guy sort of recognized me\\nand we were having the guy the Carney\\nwho ran it like when I got on oh dude I\\nlove you right and so we were having so\\nmuch fun but we weren't finished and so\\nas we he was letting everyone off I said\\njust leave us on just please he goes\\nokay I got you and we just like finished\\nswirling\\nyeah congratulations did you ever do it\\nin the swirling teacups at\\nDisneyland imagine if you did yeah boy\\nimagine throwing up like right when you\\ncome probably feel amazing cuz even\\nthough throwing up sucks it feels\\namazing when you have to throw up and\\nyou you finally do purging oh you know\\nthat feeling like last time I threw up\\nwas about a year ago and it was in the\\nmiddle of the night I got up and I was\\nlike I feel like I'm going to [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\npuke I just I just I didn't feel good\\ngoing to bed and in the middle of the\\nnight I was like wo and I woke up and I\\ngot went to the bathroom to pee or throw\\nup and I was like oh boy they might both\\nhappen at the same time oh and I held\\nthe pee and just like and then I peed\\nright over my throw up I don't give a\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] dude wow that's how Wild I yeah I\\ndidn't even bother I just pissed on the\\nthrow up I'm like just left it yeah you\\nain't going just a little throw up did\\nyou do the thing when you barfed like\\nright after you just curled up on the\\nbathroom floor in the fetal position and\\nfelt the cool tiles on your naked skin\\nnever done that me\\nneither I do lay down on the bathroom\\nfloor sometimes when I get out of the\\nsauna though oh yeah cuz the tile floor\\nlike right when you get out of the sauna\\nit's 185 [\\xa0__\\xa0] degrees or whatever it\\nis yeah I I like to lay down that cool\\ncould you do the ice soaking yeah I mean\\ninside my house when I'm inside my house\\nI saw inside my house I have one outside\\ntoo to come over later and sit in it\\nwith you yeah hang we got coups we got\\none here I'd rather do the one at your\\nhouse I think then you we can have\\ndinner too okay what you want to sleep\\nover I wouldn't mind I bet you do well\\nwe're going to work out in the morning\\nno you can you going to get the C plunge\\nno come on I'd sit in ice cream in a hot\\nday The cold plunge feels good for about\\n5\\nSeconds yeah a hot day you get in there\\nlike oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] I jumped in Lake Superior\\nonce and it was one of those things I\\nprobably stayed in about 5 minutes and\\nI've never experienced it but when I got\\nout for about 40 minutes after I was\\nshaking like it was so cold here's a\\nquestion Lake Superior massive Lake used\\nto be a glacier right yeah okay biggest\\nof the Great Lakes most of North America\\nat one point in time at least half of\\nNorth America was covered by like a mile\\nhigh sheet of ice okay right so you have\\nthis time period after the Ice Age where\\nall that melts how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] do the fish\\nget in\\nthere yeah how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] did those fish\\nget in there it's a mystery that's a\\nreally good question how those lake\\ntrout get in there in the middle of the\\ncountry these big ass giant lake trout\\nhow the [\\xa0__\\xa0] did they get in there what\\ndid they just evolve once the water\\nmelted yeah were there were there seeds\\nof the fish in the ice waiting to be\\nmelted for real though if that's all ice\\nyeah the fish ain't getting in there how\\ndo they get in the middle of the lake\\nthe lake is [\\xa0__\\xa0] huge it's filled\\nwith fish there is a possibility it's an\\nextreme one but I'm trying to answer\\nyour question that a predatory bird like\\nan osprey or a gull or some kind of\\nfisheating bird flies from the ocean\\ncaught a fish in a in a local River or a\\nnearby lake adjacent to where are those\\nnearby Lakes if the entire\\nyeah well have you ever been to a a like\\na farm or anything like that and\\nsometimes they have those water troughs\\nthat they leave out for the cows but\\nthey've been abandoned or you you come\\nto a place where there's like a little\\npuddle in a field or something right and\\nsomehow there's fish in it and there's\\nthere's there's noot and there's aqu\\nquatic creatures and you you go how how\\ndid they get here right how did a noot\\nget up and aluminum bin and get down\\ninto this ecosystem that's evolved here\\nit's fascinating it your question kind\\nof raises the questions for all of\\ncreation it's it's it's we can look at\\nEvolution we can look at at the dawn of\\ntime but it it it's really has it ever\\nbeen answered not totally I mean they\\ndon't have an exact time bytime like day\\nbyday timeline but do they have an\\nanswer to how fish got into the great\\nlegs I can't believe I never asked that\\nbefore I never even thought of it before\\nhuge body of water of course there's\\nfish in there but if the whole continent\\nwas covered 10,000 years ago in ice what\\nthe [\\xa0__\\xa0] happened well you might have to\\nsay Okay somewhere there was a tributary\\nthat came from the ocean no it would be\\nfrom North it would be from up North but\\nwhere from Hudson's Bay down into\\nSuperior and the ocean fish maybe they\\nprobably swim up River from the warm\\nareas well that's what salmon do when\\nthey SP I bet they swim up area that\\nmakes the most sense how they got in\\nthose Lakes so those Lakes must be\\nconnected to Rivers right oh yeah have\\nthey have to be they all are they\\nprobably swim up into the lake and then\\nevolve to become like these big lake\\ncreatures like Lake trouts yeah cuz Lake\\ntrouts are [\\xa0__\\xa0] huge man lake trout\\ncan get huge yeah oh man yeah people ice\\nfish them yeah that's like a big wave\\nit's they're [\\xa0__\\xa0] crazy looking yeah\\nso that thing you don't really find them\\nI mean in the southern areas right those\\nare a northern fish aren't they lake\\ntrout yeah uh they're sort of a deep\\nwaterer really cold fish so they don't\\nnecessarily have to be way up North\\nright so if they evolved so these lake\\nlakes and streams from the lower part of\\nthe country right so if you're talking\\nabout like New Mexico or something like\\nthat what some area that wasn't covered\\nin ice these things swim all the way up\\nthe river and then they evolve in this\\nLake to become bigger and to become\\nadapted to the cold deep water different\\nspecies yeah it's dude this is the\\nmystery of where we are yeah how about\\nsturgeon where St dinosur these things\\nare what 1,000 PBS or more hug monsters\\nthey look like dinosaurs prehistoric\\nthey look prehistoric have you ever seen\\nthat thing that's in the Amazon that has\\nit has essentially bulletproof scales\\nyeah yeah the they're black what is it\\ncalled I've seen Araya yeah what's up\\nJimmy just this the the way the fish got\\ninto the Great Lakes is is a way deeper\\nstore than I've uncovered so far but the\\nway salmon got there specifically in the\\n60s people brought them there yeah a guy\\nhad to bring him there m that makes\\nsense fishing became very popular back\\nthen so there was lot of dead fish\\nswimming like on the shores for some\\nreason I was trying to find out but were\\nthere any fish in there before the\\nsalmon that's the there had have been\\nthat's I was as you were first asking it\\ni' know I've seen this image recently\\nlike the depth of Lake Superior\\nspecifically very deep\\n1,333 ft [\\xa0__\\xa0] so there could maybe have\\nbeen something under there waiting for\\nthe ice to melt that came back up\\nthere's a bunch of stuff saying what he\\nsaid too was like U fish eggs get\\ndropped by other birds and end up in the\\nwater I got to think the river has a lot\\nto do with it but that was so there was\\nthis is like you can't go up Niagara\\nFalls that's true right wow you good\\nyeah good point Jamie that's a very good\\npoint right how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] does it get\\npast those God damn it what a mystery\\nyeah harl we've maybe cracked or\\nuncovered one of the biggest mysteries\\nin humankind and no one's talking about\\nit buddy yeah isn't that incredible yeah\\naren't you glad I showed up we busted it\\nout wow we're the ones the on imagine\\ntomorrow like front page of every\\nnewspaper Haron Williams and Joe Rogan\\nPOS serious question as to how fish got\\nin the Great Lakes and scientists are\\nbaffled and they all start talking to us\\ncoming to us like how did you guys\\nrealize that fish had to get into the\\nGreat Lakes when the Great Lakes used to\\nbe covered in a glacier yeah you guys\\nare geniuses untouched Geniuses of\\nNature and then maybe when Trump gets in\\nfor his second term he appoints us to\\nsome sort of a nature Advisory Board and\\nwe give uh we we could be the master\\nethologists yes we could be the people\\ntelling everybody how to fix all these\\nproblems with animals and people and but\\nsee here's the other layer of this\\nlasagna that we're not talking about\\nyou're talking about lake trout right\\nhow about the Lake Superior probably has\\n60 70 different species of fish I fished\\nLakes up beer I've caught white fish\\nI've got lake trout there's all kinds of\\nfish in there right how they get in\\nthere by the way I used to work on the\\nshores of Lake Superior and there's a PL\\nyou'd like this cuz I know you like\\nbears and you like guns and you like\\nthere's a believe it or not there's a\\nplace on the shores of Lake Super called\\nnaay Provincial Park where was such a\\ndesolate place that in World War II they\\nhad a German Nazi prisoner of war camp\\non the shores whoa and the prisoners it\\nwas so remote no one could Escape\\nbecause they would have gone into the\\nCanadian wilderness but the German\\nsoldiers captured somehow a black bear\\nand trained it to box they put boxing\\ngloves on it and then Nazi soldiers for\\nentertainment purposes would box with\\nthis black bear Jesus Christ and they\\nand they sunk a whole bunch of of of\\nwartime um vehicles in in in uh Lake\\nSuperior wow yeah how many Bonnies you\\nthink were in leg Superior I don't know\\nbut they might be preserved at so cold\\nthat's what I'm thinking if you went\\ndown yeah if you dropped them all the\\nway to the 1,300 ft just this creepy\\nskeleton with his 1970s jeans on Bottoms\\nhe might not even be a skon that's what\\nI'm saying it's so cold he might still\\nhave fles and just be like your baby in\\nthe woods just like hi Joe would you\\nlike a fresh cauliflower don't you think\\nsomething would eat them uh maybe more\\nlamp pre eels there's things alive down\\nthere lamp pre you ever seen a lamp pre\\naren't they don't they aren't they a\\nsaltwater creature no fresh water\\nthey're in Lake Ontario Oh really yeah I\\nknow they're they cling to the back\\nbottom of sharks a lot right they feed\\noff of with the shark those are raor oh\\noh that's rightor by the way L similar\\nto Lampe is one of the more horrific it\\nhas a round it's like an eel with a\\nround suction cup with circular like\\nbuzz saw teeth it a fixes itself on the\\nfish and slowly sucks their Interiors\\nout Jesus Christ look what if that was\\nin a movie you would say oh my God we\\nglad that's not real yeah that's like\\nDune right that's like the worm and dune\\nthere is a movie what's it called let me\\nsee that one where that dude's holding\\nit again that's so creepy yeah the lamp\\nlook at that [\\xa0__\\xa0] mouth man well\\nwhat's what's amazing is it sucks your\\ninsides out and slowly eats you alive so\\nit pulls the skin apart and then just\\nsucks out all the orans it literally\\ncreates a hole look at the bite in that\\ndude's hand yeah it puts a hole in the\\nfish and just stays a fixed to the same\\nspot and eats its insides out they're\\nolder than dinosaurs yeah now they're in\\nthey're in like in the the Great Lakes\\nthat's crazy how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] did they get\\nin there so that's a one attached to a\\nfish yeah that's on a lake trout right\\nthere can you show me that the photo oh\\nso that's the hole where it was uh no\\nthat's it hanging see invasive oh those\\nare the ones hanging and then see the\\nhole you can see a hole where one let go\\nand they just they just click on that\\nlink please consume the fish where are\\nthey from originally it says it's an\\ninvasive\\nspecies I don't know maybe the Amazon\\ndoes it\\nsay\\nWow right right but where are they from\\nit says it's\\ninvasive it's a sea lampy yeah they're\\nin the Great Lakes the sea sea lamp is\\ninvasive and it can cause problems in\\nlocal ecosystems it's a lot to do with\\nits size sea lamps are big compared to\\nNative species so it comes from the\\nocean somehow or\\nanother does and they can live in the in\\nfresh water that's crazy well apparently\\nthe girl I think her name's Maria Bell\\nwas the first person to ever swim across\\nLake Ontario and she had to swim through\\nschools of those apparently when she\\nswam across Lake Ontario Oh my God\\nimagine those little [\\xa0__\\xa0] grabbing a\\nall your [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah they're the\\nperfect they they almost got [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nsuckers for mouths yeah like they're\\nperfect geez hate to see Demetri around\\none of those so in the 1950s US and\\nCanada teamed up for population control\\nmeasures and they have worked several\\nstrategies including traps to capture\\nadult lampes lamp PR PR l size poison\\nTarget seed lampy larva and installing\\nbarriers are few tactics to use so far\\nworking what does it\\nsay\\noh that's a good thing left multiply SE\\nlamp re could significant damage to the\\nRegion's seven billion dollar fishing\\nindustry huh lamp bre creepy little\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah and then the\\nrora look how weird that thing is the\\nrora has a suction cup on its head so\\nthe top of its head had is a suction cup\\nlook at that and I was sexually\\nassaulted in Florida i' had been eating\\na bacon sandwich and spilled some on my\\nlap and went swimming and that thing\\nsucked me for about an hour and a half\\nlook at the top of his head well\\nsomeone's not paying attention I'm\\npaying attention I had a sexual assault\\nand you glazed right over I didn't\\nbelieve you well it's true it lasted too\\nlong I can show you theck for like 30\\nseconds I said oh my God that thing\\nclung to his leg for 30 seconds but I\\nmaybe I wanted to last remember you're\\ntalking to the dyer sex guy here right\\nthe guy with the the baby inside do you\\nknow that the whates it say sucker fish\\nlatches to swimmer whoa there he go look\\nat her she's hot but you know the\\nSpanish fishermen you know there was a\\ntime when you could eat sea turtles\\nright and the rora will swim to whatever\\nis moving because they feed off of the\\nthey're like they're like parasitic fish\\nwhen the shark eats they'll catch all\\nthe all the scraps so Spanish fish\\num their to their Ingenuity they used to\\neat sea turtles and when they'd catch a\\nrora they'd keep it alive in the boat\\nand when they saw a sea turtle they'd\\nput it on their line throw it in the\\nwater the remor would go to the sea\\nturtles stick on the shell and they'd\\nreel in sea turtles used to be able to\\neat them yeah that's how they got no\\nyou're making this up no that's for real\\nthis was this was in the past they clung\\nto the sea turtle and that's how they\\npulled it so they used it like a magnet\\nto se yeah you saw the size of the\\nsucker on its head right so it it would\\nstick to the sea turtle and then they\\ncould in essence pull in the yeah see\\nthere's one wow yeah so if you want to\\ngo fishing for sea turtles later let me\\nknow that's crazy yeah some good sucking\\ngoing on in the oce they take the sea\\nturtles and flip them on their back and\\nput them in the bottom of the the ship\\nand then when they wanted to eat one\\nthey just pick it up cuz when you flip\\nthem on their back they can't turn over\\nso they just lay there yeah and they\\ncould stay alive for a long time without\\nfood or water yeah cuz they're air\\nbreathers yeah so you just leave them in\\nthere until you want cook one yeah throw\\na leave over it pick it up it's like\\nfresh food I've seen a bunch of videos\\nof people cooking and eating sea turtles\\nin other countries uh because there's\\nlike some cooking show or fishing show\\nwhere some guy went with them and you're\\nnot allowed to do it but you can be\\nthere while people are doing it you know\\nif you're an American you're not allowed\\nto kill a sea turtle but in some parts\\nof the world like their local culture\\nyou know like in some like some places\\nyeah Inuits are allowed to eat whale\\nthey can kill whale they kill walrus\\nseals all that stuff so these people are\\nallowed to kill sea turtles but there's\\nsomething like really disturbing about\\nwatching a sea turtle get hacked apart\\nyeah cuz they're so gentle I know and\\nthey're so like what is happening yeah\\nthey're just like little dummies they\\nnot like a fish like a fish fish is just\\nlike their eyes don't move that good\\nthey just move around a little like\\nyou're so over removed from me I'm going\\nto cut your head off and serve you a\\nsushi sweet I was just in the Galapagos\\nIsland uh swimming underwater with sea\\nturtles holding their flippers\\nalso so sweet that's cute also sea\\nturtles trying to seem tough but Turtles\\nare always good guys yeah in movies and\\nlike Ninja Turtles they're the good guys\\nright there like turtles are like your\\nfriend yeah they're buddies yeah they're\\nyour wise pal the turtles never [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nit's never really a [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nturtle in like movie depictions yeah can\\nyou think of a Cy\\nTurtle uh\\nGod remember that giant turtle that\\nfought Godzilla and he like fire would\\ncome out of his\\nskill go fly he spit around what was\\nthis D again CUNY no I don't think so\\nwell but like turtles that's like one of\\nthose things that happens with people\\nthat's why people like love bears CU you\\nhave teddy bears you know you have teddy\\nbears and you know you got Yogi and you\\nknow only you can prevent forest fires\\nall that stuff like oh bears are your\\nfriends they're sweet yeah and it's what\\na great PR campaign these murderous\\nassassins have pulled off getting us to\\nlike reintroduce them into areas where\\npeople are like we your friends they're\\nnot they're monsters big ass monsters\\nyeah with a good PR campaign polar bears\\nwill e you faster than they'll do\\nanything else here's a here's a fact\\nowls are\\ndumb I thought they were wise I did too\\nI talked to a woman who trains birds and\\nshe had all these different birds she\\nhad Hawks and paragen Falcons and all\\nshe's\\nowls are the dumbest there's only one\\nanimal dumber than them that's one of\\nthose big animals one of those big birds\\nrather that's dumber than them one them\\nbig birds from Australia what are those\\nthings called that's it that that one's\\nDumber really that's the only animal\\nthat's dumber than an owl just like owls\\nare so\\ndumb I thought they were wise I had one\\nbooing outside of my house about two\\nweeks ago keeping me awake all night and\\nI'm like how do you deal with the wisest\\nof all the birds right so I go outside I\\nthrow a Rubik's Cube up into the tree it\\ncomes back 30 seconds later perfectly\\ndone so I don't think they're that dumb\\nwow I had I maybe you got an autistic\\nkid living in your tree\\nyeah Johnny I'm trying to sleep come\\ndown Johnny he's up there counting out\\nloud so check this out Joe\\nI he's out there doing long math in his\\nhead he's up there eating celery 5,000\\ndivided by 16 a beautiful mine th that\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nrub throws it back to you he keeps going\\non with his math I did a I did do a\\nmovie Once where um I played a wizard\\nand I had a Eurasian eagle owl I think\\nthey're the biggest of all the\\nowls and they trained it to land on my\\narm on the big leather glove yeah and\\nI'd never worked with owls up close like\\nthat and the trainer he was sitting like\\nthis with his Talons and the trainer\\nsaid grab the back Talon and pull it and\\nI said well I don't I don't want to hurt\\nthe thing you know I she said no pull it\\nso I I grabbed the back and I you know I\\ngave it a tug and it didn't move and he\\ngoes no pull it as hard as you can and\\nyou know these are these big claws I\\ngrab it I could not move it and he goes\\nthis is what an owl's death grip feels\\nlike when it clanks onto something it's\\nover I could not believe the strength in\\nin that Talon it was crazy yeah I mean\\nthey're Raptors yeah they're just it's\\nwild their claws when you see an eagle's\\nclaw when they give you a close-up and\\nyou it's like a human hand but with\\nSpears at the tip of the fingers but I\\ndidn't understand the strength of them\\njust like much stronger than your hands\\nyeah oh yeah well imagine what they do\\nwhen they just snatch a salmon out of\\nthe water and fly away with it I look at\\nthose things man yeah that's insane I\\nmean that is straight up dinosaur tools\\nlook at that [\\xa0__\\xa0] and look at all the\\ntexture to it all the muscles and T what\\na monster and way more powerful than you\\nwould you would think just by looking at\\nit oh yeah I actually the the if you\\nlook at the claws of the osprey look at\\nthat owls those are fake that's he's got\\ntwo hands bro that's real no those are\\nno that's the wise owl that's the real\\nWise Owl that can't be I don't think\\nthey read books with those\\nyeah he's up there in the tree reading\\nbooks I didn't even the problem with it\\nat first I like what's wrong with oh\\nyeah okay yeah welcome to the\\ninternet but I was so shocked that owls\\nare dumb really why whoa look at those\\nclaws is that the Eurasian eagle owl oh\\nmy God oh my great horned owl look at\\nthose things that's so amazing that's\\nwhat took my chihuahua did they really\\nyeah I had a Chihuahua and one of those\\nbastards cuz they're big too those are\\nfairly big they get a lot of cats\\nimagine my little Chihuahua getting\\npicked apart by that\\nF wow I um have a friend and he was uh\\ntelling I think Steve Rell was telling\\nus on the podcast was he about the like\\nthey found this one Owl's Nest and it\\nwas filled with like cats little collar\\noh wow yeah there like 30 different cat\\ncollar something like that yeah that's\\nwhat the [\\xa0__\\xa0] man they're just snatching\\ncats out of people's backyard and like I\\nsaid it's a\\ntabby\\ndri Gone\\nGone sound if you hear this if\\nhear and there you ever heard like the\\ndifference between the sound an owl\\nmakes when it flies they've done like\\nthese like where they record the\\nnoise it's insane it's silent when you\\nsee an Hawk do it or an eagle do it\\nthere's all this different different\\nbirds have noise and then the Owl makes\\nlike no [\\xa0__\\xa0] noise the aerodynamics\\nof an owl they're like like stealth\\nbombers just silent you know another\\nwild one is tuna when tuna go through\\nthe water they can go through the water\\nto grab someone and and grab something\\nand they don't even make a ripple like\\nwhen they go over the top of the W it's\\ncrazy I watch video of it it's bizarre\\nwhen they jump yeah no when they're\\ngoing through the top of the water they\\njust slide through it like a KN like a\\nknight\\nyeah so that's a hawk\\nyeah and now now watch the owl it's Ken\\nturn\\nnothing silent silent silent nighttime\\nkiller nature dumb as [\\xa0__\\xa0] big stupid\\nhead with giant eyes dumb as [\\xa0__\\xa0] just\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] killing everything it can are\\nthey're not that dumb are they got to be\\nsmarter a woodpecker I think woodpeckers\\nare way smarter really I don't know what\\nabout a blue H I don't think you train\\nwoodpeckers this lady probably has a\\nlimited database to work with everything\\nlike she's got on her arm is like a\\nraptor except for the owl like like the\\nFalcons she said the hardest Hawks and\\nFalcons she goes they just kill\\neverything like you let them go they\\njust go find things they'll kill\\nsquirrels they find they just they just\\ncan't stop killing okay and she goes\\nthese these things just like they're\\nkilling machines she go I let them go\\nthey just find things and kill it like\\nimmediately yeah find a bird kill it fly\\nup to the bird kill it they come back to\\nher but they just go kill things first\\noh this is a trained Falcon W yeah\\nthey're all trained but it doesn't\\nmatter like if you let a hawk go Hawks\\njust go find something to kill yeah like\\nwhat what our guys to kill they just fly\\naround like what oh Bird yeah boom dead\\nthey're not even trying to eat it\\nsquirrel [\\xa0__\\xa0] you bam kill that squirrel\\nso sport killing sport killing they're\\njust designed to kill cuz not a lot of\\nanimals do that some animals can't help\\nthemselves Lions do it to hyenas yeah\\nbut I bet that lion did it to that lady\\nin that car I bet she was eatting her I\\nbet that was a little bit of sport\\nthere's another old video where some\\nlike Danish guy's going through a lion\\nsafari with his wife and kids and he got\\nout he was with his camera and literally\\nthe kids and the wife you see them in\\nthe car going berserk and his legs are\\nkicking in the air and the Lions just\\ncame and devoured him right in front of\\nthe wife and kids like the idiot got out\\nsome people are just [\\xa0__\\xa0] stupid man\\nthat's Darwin right yeah that's that's\\nthe whole idea is like those people are\\nnot supposed to make it yeah yeah you're\\nnot supposed to make it but they've\\nalready breed bread that's a problem at\\nleast the kid has the benefit of seeing\\nhis dad get like my dad was so dumb like\\nyou know you can have a dumb dad and get\\nthrough things and be a different person\\nthan your dad was and if you're a dumb\\nkid and your dad is dumb as [\\xa0__\\xa0] your\\ndad gets out and gets eaten by a lion in\\nfront of you that has a profound effect\\nI got to be honest not even saying that\\nkid's dumb or that you know maybe the\\nkid's a genius you could be you have a\\ngenius kid be stupid I got to be honest\\nthough Joe in this world we live in\\nwhere you know humans expire primarily\\nyou know in a hospital bed or at home\\nand around their loved ones with a\\ndisease with whatever cancer right I\\nreally would rather die like jumping a\\nlion like you know at the at the family\\nfunction how did he die he attacked a\\nlion he went out on his shield huh yeah\\nyou went out on your Shield yeah yeah\\nlike I I want to Noble the death of like\\nlike a warrior right yeah and going back\\nto that story this is going to sound\\nridiculous no way\\nyeah but going back to the story where I\\ntold you I saw the lion when my hand was\\nshaking there was that terrified part of\\nme this is for Real there were two male\\nlions no one else in the middle of\\nAfrica part of me wanted to jump out of\\nthe truck and just run at the T the lion\\nand attack it knowing that I'd die but\\nknowing that it would be the most\\nglorious death of a a man with courage\\nor stupidity but at least I would die in\\na fashion where spectacular way in the\\nreal world organic nature Man versus\\nbeast beast versus Beast cuz I don't\\nlike to think of us as Superior to other\\ncreatures but it just that actually\\npopped into my head I thought I don't\\nwant to I don't want to expire in the\\nleukemia a ward I don't want to be in\\nhospice right I've lived a good life\\nyeah so imagine I just run at a line in\\nthat last moment I get to see the shock\\nin its face of a human daring to jump on\\nit and grab it yeah and they would have\\nbeen on me in a second but I don't know\\nis that weird no like have you ever\\nthought how you want to die well if\\nyou're going to die and you know\\nespecially if you're older and you know\\nit's\\nsoon to go just run at that line next\\ntime have you ever thought about that\\nno would you would you be fine just\\nexpiring in a hospital bed like yeah\\nthat's better than being torn apart in\\nfront of your\\nfamily yeah I'm not saying do it in\\nfront of your family about the people\\nthat not in front of your family but if\\nyou just have going\\nget to take you to the line let's say\\nyou're out hunting a Grizz and one day\\nyou just go you know what you put the\\nrifle down and you just run at them and\\ngo this is how I want to go punching\\npunching a Grizz in the face knowing\\nyou're going to die but you go out in\\nthat that wild punching a Grizz in the\\nface is like an ant punching you it's\\nlike being attacked by a kitten with no\\nclaws it is it's like but you get that\\nmoment of being a man of of feeling that\\npower you'd rather just that's a stupid\\nway have a heart attack yeah okay yeah\\nthat's a stupid way to die well I mean\\nit's one thing if you get attacked by an\\nanimal and you're out in the woods and\\nit's like hey this is the price you pay\\nfor being in nature that's thing they\\nattack us why can't we attack them now\\nflip it around okay I'd like to yeah you\\ncan okay good maybe I'm even inviting\\nyou to come with me to do it if you ever\\nfind out that you're going to die and\\nthat's how you want to go I'll go you\\ncome with me yeah definitely I'll bring\\na rifle in case you change your mind you\\nwouldn't run like if like as you're\\nrunning like Joe change my mind boom\\nI'll have my crosshairs on them you\\nwouldn't run to the animal with me no no\\nI'll be there to\\nwatch if you want me to yeah I'd love\\nthat okay it' be a special moment with\\nshare I love share I'll be there when\\nyou pass over into the next stage of\\nlife and but you got to do me favor yeah\\nif like Heaven's real if like there is\\nan afterlife or whatever it is just let\\nme know oh I would come back and tell me\\ncome in a dream tell me in a dream yeah\\nhave you had a dream of someone who died\\nand it seemed like super\\nrealistic\\nooh\\nyes I think I have what was it it might\\nhave been my dad ooh yeah I just I just\\nremember being really sad like he's gone\\nand there was like this wave of\\nemptiness\\ncuz my mother did die and are your\\nparents still with us yes so when my\\nmother died like this hole formed in my\\nheart like it literally felt like a hole\\nand it it can't close like I I I can\\ncome to peace with it I can yeah I can\\nbe at Harmony with the fact that she's\\ngone but and I wasn't even super close\\nwith my mom but the hole that got left\\nin my heart it's like woo it's I can if\\nI focus on it I can feel it immediately\\nand it's that that just that connection\\nto the mother the the person that\\nbrought you into this world you know is\\nreally really powerful and so in the\\ndream what happened with your dad I\\ncan't remember it's foggy what I\\nremember more than the actual moment is\\nthat feeling that feeling of emptiness\\nthat oh they're they're gone you know\\njust gone forever and and it it was\\nreally sort of this sad Crush ing\\nfeeling on my soul it's it's\\npowerful I had a dream after Phil\\nHartman died oh and uh it wasn't that\\nlong after his death and uh in the dream\\nI ran into him and it was very realistic\\ncuz we were outside and he had like one\\nof those folding lawn chairs and it was\\non the ground and I\\nsaid I said hello\\nand he was explaining to me that him and\\nhis wife had worked it out you know this\\nis after his wife killed him you know\\nyou were right there too right I wasn't\\nthere when it happened no but you were\\nworking the show when it happened right\\nyeah yeah Jesus and he he laughed about\\nit like yeah we had a lot to work\\nthrough like but we're good now\\nsomething along those lines and then he\\nsat down on the lawn chair and like fell\\nbackwards like it stumbled back Awards\\nand then I looked and he was gone it was\\nreally weird cuz and then I realized it\\nwas a dream and then I woke up but I\\nremember thinking like in the moment\\nlike that seemed so realistic like he\\nwas like telling me he's okay cuz I\\ntried to get him to divorce that lady a\\nbunch of times while I was working with\\nhim yeah cuz he would they would fight\\nlike crazy fights where he would just\\ndisappear for a couple he would leave\\nthe house and and he was telling me he\\nwanted to get divorced but he didn't\\nwant the lawyers to take a third because\\nit's like I was like just kid about a\\nhalf no no no the the the it's 2/3 so\\nthe lawyer takes a third this is what he\\nwas telling me he's like I go just give\\nher half you're always going to make\\nmoney just get out be free just be you\\nyou know and he was terrified of that he\\nwas terrified of leaving and so when he\\nfinally decided to leave she murdered\\nhim in his sleep she shot him and then\\nshe shot herself and my friend was\\nactually my friend who was a cop was\\nactually there when she shot herself oh\\nso that happened when the police\\napproached the house yes yes oh wow yeah\\nthe police broke into the house to try\\nto save the kids and she shot herself\\nthe kids ran away from their mom he told\\nme so he he told I hadn't I hadn't done\\nstand up in two weeks after the murder I\\nwas just yeah I I just couldn't imagine\\nanything being funny and and then I\\ndecided two weeks later to try to go to\\nThe Comedy Store so I'm at the gas\\nstation and while I was at the gas stage\\nmy friend who was a cop was there and I\\nwas like hey what's up how you doing he\\ngoes like how you doing you good I go\\nyeah he goes you know I was there I go\\nreally and then he told me the whole\\nstory about how he was there and they\\nsaw the the mom in the bathroom with the\\ngun and the kids ran away from the mom\\nwhen the cops broke down the door cuz\\nthe cops saw her with the in the\\nbathroom with the gun yeah and a lot of\\ntimes in murder suicides the mother will\\nkill her children too of course yeah and\\nso they were she was in there with the\\ngun talking to the kids and the kids\\nfreaked out and then when they broke\\ndown the front door the kids ran away\\nfrom the mom and she just blew her\\nbrains out the only good side is they\\ndidn't see her do that I'm guessing I'm\\nhoping they didn't see that there's no\\ngood side I mean there's no good side\\nyou lose your mother and your father in\\na murder homicide in one night and\\nyou're like what you mean there's no\\ngood side with your intuition like\\nobviously you were advising Phil to get\\naway yeah was there ever a foresight in\\nyour head that she would murder him wow\\nno no no no no isn't that funny how we\\njust don't know people but first of all\\nshe was also on Zoloft and cocaine and\\nthe family won some sort of a settlement\\nwith\\nZoloft um not much but you there's\\ninstances where people mix zolof with\\ncocaine that they have psychotic\\nreactions yeah and I suspect that's what\\nwas going on and she was she they hated\\neach other they they loved each other\\nand they hated each other you know it's\\none of those deals like she she would\\ninsult him publicly it was it was rough\\nman and you know I was just saying like\\nyou're a great guy like you don't need\\nto be going through this like you need\\nto get divorced and have you know share\\ncustody of your kids and and try to set\\nan example and just not you can't do\\nthis like the fighting was so bad it was\\nand he hated it he didn't want to be\\nmarried to her he he was he was stuck\\nand I told him like you you can't just\\nstay stuck and just let these\\ncircumstances overcome your existence\\nyeah you no matter how hard it is you\\nhave to push through so we had a break\\nwe done filming for a bit till we went\\nback for the next season and um one day\\nI woke up and someone called me and told\\nme and then I saw it on the news and\\nit's just like what and then everybody\\nwas calling everybody and we all got\\ntogether we were like\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] it's just so hard to believe it\\ndoesn't make sense it's like yeah how\\nwas he your buddy like were you friends\\nwith him off set like did you chum\\naround and stuff yeah he actually took\\nme up in his plane once um to uh find\\nwhere I W up buying a house cuz I was he\\ngoes one of the cool things about flying\\nhe like I can show you cuz he had just\\ngot he had gotten his pilot license\\nwhile we were on the show together yeah\\nand like and so he was always practicing\\nthat he bought one of these single\\nengine planes it was pretty cool and so\\nhe said you want to come out for a a\\nflight I'll show you around I'm like\\nyeah yeah let's do it and so we we flew\\naround the valley and like showed me all\\nthese different areas and it's like he\\nwas a he was a great guy man did you\\nsweet sweet guy given the turmoil in his\\nrelationship were you privy to the\\nknowledge that they had a gun in the\\nhouse no no I had no idea cuz you got a\\nwhen you're going through something bad\\nwith a spouse I mean I I don't think\\nit's good having a gun in the house cuz\\nsomeone could flip like that you know I\\nguess yeah that's a horrible thing to\\nthink but I don't even know uh whose gun\\nit was I don't know anything you know I\\ndon't know if it was her gun I don't\\nknow if he knew about the gun I I don't\\nknow damn yeah but the dream the dream\\nwas so strange cuz the dream was like\\nhim letting me know he's fine it was he\\nwas Phil he was laughing he was like he\\nmade some sort of a joke about his wife\\nkilling him and that we got through that\\nnow and then he sat down on the lawn\\nchair and fell backwards like it slipped\\nback and like I think I looked down at\\nthe ground and I looked at him and he\\nwas gone\\nand then I was like oh this is a dream\\nand then I woke up did you feel like\\nclosure to a weir weirdly it felt like\\nit was him letting me know not to freak\\nout about it yeah like Let It Go yeah\\ndude but you're always going to freak\\nout about it you freak out about the\\nkids yeah the kids is the big one that\\nyou just can't imagine what it'd be like\\nif that was you if you were a kid and\\nthen all a sudden your mom shoots your\\ndad and then shoots herself and then\\nit's public it's not just it's not just\\nthat it's this thing that you have to\\ndeal with it's the thing that everybody\\nwants to talk to you about cuz the whole\\nworld knows about it because he was a\\nfamous guy yeah you know well not only\\nfamous but what really he was loved but\\nwhat really kind of was hard to get your\\nhead around is you have this guy who's\\nan extreme comedy Force right yeah and\\nyou don't think of joyous sort of Comedy\\npeople that elicit laughter and violence\\nlike that and so the fact here was his\\nfunny sort of hahaa guy that brought so\\nmuch left and then that kind of ending\\nit's it's like it just doesn't fit well\\nnot only that it's like when does the\\nwife kill the husband with a gun how\\noften is it that's so rare execution\\nstyle in the sleep sleeping oh my God\\nwhat must have been going through her\\nhead too Soul Loft and cocaine yeah\\nwhat's soft it's an anti-depressant SSRI\\noh yeah\\nwow yeah Google the the results of the\\nside effects of mixing zolof with\\ncocaine I think there's a few\\npsychiatric medications that you if you\\nmix with alcohol or if you mix with\\ncocaine you get really crazy behavior\\nlike people just go off the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nrails yeah I don't know even how much\\ncontrol they have I don't know what that\\nfeels like like what does that feel like\\nyou're on zolof and COC you might be\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] a raving Maniac yeah you know\\njust that you got get anything on\\nthat soof yeah like just that name\\nsounds like it's crazy time sounds like\\nit's from the Star Trek yeah it sounds\\nlike one of the planets they landed on\\nright zolof is not com the zolof are\\nhere I wonder if they named it that to\\nmake it seem like it's super Advanced\\nlike you're going to take Zola oh it's\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] super Advanced it just sounds\\nlike nutty time that's going to fix it\\nyeah that's going to fix it like if\\nthere was a legitimate happy that worked\\nlike that with everybody that gave you\\nlike sort of like a low dose of MDMA all\\nthroughout the day yeah it's probably a\\ngood thing for everybody there's no side\\neffects I'm mixed on that yeah because I\\nthink we were\\nbioengineered to have what we have and\\nwhen you yeah on a daily basis if you\\nstart tinkering with what what the\\nstructure was how it was already the\\narchitecture of the structure\\nI feel like it's not maybe necessarily a\\ngood thing taking cocaine and\\nanti-depressants can interfere with your\\nmedications ability to balance the\\nlevels of neurotransmitters in your\\nbrain making them ineffective and\\npossibly worsening your symptoms\\nessentially anti-depressants are meant\\nto correct any chemical imbalances that\\nmay contribute to depression such as low\\nserotonin cocaine on the other hand is\\nabused to spike dop What do you say\\nabused how about youed Buddy to spike\\ndopamine and serotonin levels producing\\nan energetic and euphoric High although\\nthis Rush of dopamine and serotonin\\nmakes them feel great for a few minutes\\nmixing anti-depressants and cocaine can\\nproduce serotonin syndrome which is\\nmarked by symptoms like confusion\\nanxiety fear diarrhea vomiting seizures\\nand coma additionally taking cocaine\\nwith other drugs also increases the\\nindividuals risk of addiction chronic\\nusers often require cocaine addiction\\ntreatment and treatment for cocaine\\nwithdrawal symptoms to recover do you um\\nis there Zoloft mixing Zoloft and\\ncocaine psychotic behavior Google that\\noh there's got to be cuz I think that\\nwas something that like in limited\\nnumbers of people they observed some\\nlike craziness yeah that's uh poor guy\\nman sorry dude that's a traumatic story\\nyeah it's a rough story but you know it\\nhappened 25 years ago or whatever it was\\nstill it's just like crazy crazy to\\nbelieve it's hard to believe you know\\nit's hard to believe that someone could\\ndo that to someone that they married to\\nthat they have children with that they\\nlove supposedly that you would lose your\\nmind that far that you would shoot them\\nin the sleep it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] well it's the\\nJimmy Hendrick um Jim Morrison from the\\ndoors you know Janice Joplin syndrome\\nthey were cut down they left us with who\\nknows what else to offer us you know\\nlike so many Untold joke stories moments\\nlike Phil Hartman was obviously\\nmulti-talented as an actor too he was an\\nartist as well album covers covers what\\nwould still cuz I think didn't he get\\nkilled in his late 30s no he's in his\\n40s 40s so I don't think he even made\\nmade it onto Satur Night Live until he\\nwas in his late 30s that was like the\\nthing of him is like he was a grinder\\nfor so long and he was so talented and\\nhe just didn't make it until he did and\\nthen everybody's like oh my God this\\nguy's amazing yeah he was [\\xa0__\\xa0] great\\non news radio too such a good comedic\\nactor so funny man such so good at\\ndelivering a line like oh such a\\nprofessional yeah and it was interesting\\nbecause he came over from s live which\\nis like this really competitive like\\nshitty environment they snipe at each\\nother and do horrible things to each\\nother behind the scenes they do yeah he\\ntold me it was terrible like and so when\\nhe came to news radio to the sitcom\\nwhich was the opposite everybody was\\nvery loose everybody was silly we'd all\\ngo out drinking together and you know it\\nwas a good time like there wasn't any\\nlike weird shittiness oh good and he\\ndidn't he had like adjust so we would\\ntell me about it like the the the like\\nhe used like to smoke a little weed so\\nI'd hang out with him and he'd smoke\\nthis is back when I wasn't smoking weed\\nand he'd smoke a little weedd we'd talk\\nabout stuff and just like you know like\\nhe hated being there it's like it was\\njust all backstabbers and yeah I've\\nheard I've heard that story at SNL yeah\\nthey they'll steal your ideas for your\\nsketches and you know Jim Brewer had\\nhorrible stories about that where they\\nlike he had sketch ideas and he'd put\\nthem in like the spreadsheet and they\\nthey could read the spreadsheet of what\\nyou were going do SK the the sketches on\\nso other senior writers would steal\\nthose sketches and say we're doing\\nsomething on that and just like [\\xa0__\\xa0] you\\nman yeah it was just like this constant\\nbattle and he said he had it with cast\\nmembers he had it with writers and so\\nPhil was like GH that's not conducive\\nfor comedy that just the worst yeah it's\\nthe worst for comedy but that's like\\nthat really weak man like backstabbing\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] when they get power that that\\nhappen happens and some when they have\\ntoo much power unchecked and no one's\\nwatching them and they get away with\\nthings like stealing younger writers\\npremises and this and it's all Doge eat\\ndog everybody's just trying to get to\\nthe top like that's always been a part\\nof standup always been a part of\\ncomedies like people stealing people's\\nbits and the the the famous person\\nsteals them and the the unfamous\\nperson's [\\xa0__\\xa0] and destroys their lives\\nlike we've seen it happen before has\\nanyone ripped you off ever yeah sure a\\nbunch of times yeah yeah yeah I\\nconfronted people and they told me they\\nwouldn't do it again then I heard they\\nwere doing it again like there's there's\\ncertain people that have always been\\nBuccaneers they've always been joke\\nBuccaneers you know it's it's a and you\\nknow they don't have any friends those\\nthose people they have they sometimes\\nhave like like a vampire familiar\\nopening act so this opening act will go\\nwith them and they'll steal bits from\\nthem too there was a bunch of guys that\\ngot away with that before the internet\\nrolled around there was there was a\\npredatory type of comedian\\nthat would just poach other people's\\npremises and sort of rework them they\\ndidn't have any there was nothing that\\nthey did that was creative on their own\\neverything was derivative of somebody\\nelse's work everything I always heard\\nand I'm sure he could do you know\\nanything he wanted on his own valtion\\nbut I had always heard stories that\\nRobin Williams was that guy did you ever\\nhear I heard I heard a lot of stories\\nthat he was that guy yeah and I think\\nRobin Williams was so like part of that\\nmanic sort of style it's like this\\nconstant need to have a a bit about\\nanything that you're talking about ever\\nand killing I think was more important\\nand filling that hole inside of him was\\nmore important than anything and so he\\nwould just do other people's stuff if he\\ndidn't have anything to say did he get\\nconfronted by other comedians oh yeah\\nyeah there's a lot of stories Kennison\\ngot mad at him oh really he stole from\\nKennison yeah he stole from everybody\\nstole from a lot of people so it is true\\ni' always heard that yeah yeah it's true\\nif you ask any of those comics from back\\nthen there's always instances of Robin\\ngoing on a talk show and doing your bit\\nor going on this and doing your bit and\\nyeah doing your bit at a club yeah with\\nhim do you think it was cuz he was just\\nso spontaneous he would just like puke\\nit out or there's no way you you you've\\nhad I think he wanted to kill more than\\nhe wanted to be ethical so at any cost\\nany and especially back then when no one\\nwas really watching you other than\\ncomedians like even up into the 2000s\\nlike the a thing happen in 2007 right\\neven then they they were more willing to\\nside with someone who they thought was\\nmore profitable than the the the truth\\nthan the truth about like what is this\\nperson doing and how are they getting\\nthis material this is pretty clear that\\nthey're plagiarizing and if it's any\\nother form of entertainment like music\\nlike they'll they'll bring you to court\\nand you lose like you and then all the\\nmoney from those songs has to to the\\noriginal person because you copied their\\nsong like that's a that's a classic\\nthing happens in literature all the time\\nuh that woman who was the president of\\nHarvard got busted plagiarizing she's\\nnot a president of Harvard anymore\\nthere's all that's there's consequences\\nalways but in comedy it's always been\\nself- policed yeah you know and so that\\nwas it was a so it's a weird thing that\\nthing that people do where they try to\\nPawn off other people's bits as their\\nown like it's a vampire thing because\\nyou're around all these creative people\\nand you're just stealing a little bit\\nfrom this guy and a little bit from that\\nguy and people are scared of you did you\\never put a guy up against the wall and\\nno I didn't have to do that how come cuz\\nI just said things like you just\\nverbally confront man don't do my\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] material anymore you know that's\\nmy material yeah just like that and you\\nknow they're probably still going to do\\nit unless you want to hurt them but it's\\nlike the thing about those people they\\nalways get caught and when they get\\ncaught they they everything after that\\nsucks this is how you know if a thief is\\nlegitimately a thief if they're being\\nunjustly accused they're always going to\\ncome up with new material they're always\\ngoing to be creative they're always\\ngoing to have new great jokes because\\nthey're they're actually writing and\\nworking on it but if they're but if it's\\ntrue what you see is an initial special\\nor something or a few things they do\\nthat are really funny and then you see\\nthis massive drop off in like the\\nconcepts they talk about the what the\\nthe the irony that they discover they\\ndon't have any like legitimate points\\nwhere you're like wow that is crazy\\nthere's none of that it all goes away\\nand it becomes almost like a person\\ndoing an impression of the original\\nsuccessful person because they have no\\ncreativity and now now they're exposed\\nso now they have to be really careful so\\nyou see that with every Thief you see a\\ncouple early like big specials or\\nsomething and then you see massive drop\\noff and terrible performance after that\\nit's because they're not real yeah I\\nthink I can think of a they're they're\\nparasites that's what they are they're\\nvampires and they they're they're\\nstealing from artists and they're\\ntolerated a lot of times because they're\\nvery successful and one of the creepy\\nthings they do is they start hiring\\npeople to work for them like they'll\\nhave a television show or something\\nthey'll hire legitimate people to work\\nfor them and those people now become\\nlike they become like confidants and so\\nthey kind of keep it under wraps they\\ntry to like defend that person publicly\\nit's a very slick PR move for scumbags\\nand some of those people working for\\nthem could be writers that will steal\\nfor them too on their behalf that\\nbecomes a problem too one of the things\\nthat we noticed um in the early days of\\nthe store is that the guys who are\\nthieves their opening ax would become\\nthieves because even if the opening acts\\nhad potential and some of them got out\\nof it and actually became like legit\\nComics eventually but they were seeing\\nthe shortcuts this guy was taking they\\nwere seeing this guy driving a Mercedes\\nand they're like I want to take\\nshortcuts too this is how you do it if\\nyou want to get by this is my mentor if\\nthat's your Mentor if your Mentor is a\\nBuccaneer and you know you're like okay\\nI guess this is a [\\xa0__\\xa0] I thought I\\nwas an artist I guess it's a doggy dog\\nworld uh eventually I'll stop stealing\\nbut right now I got to make it bad\\napproach crazy kind of crazy did anyone\\never approach you and say hey Rogan\\nthat's my bit no I have had people\\napproach me where I know that it wasn't\\ntheir bit and I know they were trying to\\nsteal a bit oh really one of the things\\nthat thieves will do I actually do a bit\\non that too yeah and you're like that's\\nreally interesting cuz I've been doing\\nthis bit for two years and you've seen\\nme do comedy so what do we do in here so\\nthere's like a thing they do to let you\\nknow hey I didn't steal this from you\\nbut I have a bit on that too but you\\nkind of did didn't you yeah you know\\nthere's those moment it's that little\\nkind of poke the cage and then there's\\nalso like uh public events like some big\\nthing that happens everyone's going to\\nhave a bit on it you know like the\\nsubmarine explo you can't say hey I do a\\nbit on the submarine\\nthe border wall everybody's got AIT on\\nthe border wall like this is like\\nthere's certain things where it's just\\nyou know but you just know we know who's\\nwriting we see them we see them go up\\nyou know if you go to the Mothership On\\nAny Given night someone's going to do a\\njoke The Bobs and then that joke maybe\\nnext time they'll tweak it you know\\nmaybe they come up into the Green Room\\nthis many times has happened we'll one\\nof us will say a joke I'll say a joke\\nI'm like this joke is just [\\xa0__\\xa0] I\\ncan't go anywhere with it I got I know\\nthere's something there but\\nwe'll wework and then will go up with\\nthe of it that's like tightened up and\\nthen it starts killing like you got we\\ngot it it works and so it's like this\\nlike Cooperative project but it's just\\nif you're not doing that then you're not\\ncreating new material because new\\nmaterial is never perfect it's always\\nlike sometimes sometimes it is sometimes\\nyou have a bit like came to you every\\nnow and then came to you and it's\\nhilarious right away and it kind of\\nstays in that same form but then a lot\\nof times it's like you know there's\\nsomething there but you don't know how\\nyou're going to extract it yeah some of\\nmy favorite moment is I'm I'm one of\\nthese guys I don't know why I do this I\\nthink it's for the thrill of the kill\\nbut I love to go to the the show early\\nlike at the store or whatever I'll go\\nlike you know two Comics early and I'll\\nsit in the\\nback and I don't know what my opening\\nbits going to be and I realized those\\ntwo Comics have between them about I\\ndon't know 25 minutes they're doing 12\\nminutes each and I go between them and\\nme going up I got to come up with my\\nopening bit and I'll create it as I'm in\\nthe back of the room I call it kind of\\nsort of like swimming you know reaching\\nfor air when you're drowning right well\\nyou know you have to say something I\\nhave to forces your brain to come up\\nwith something funny to say off the top\\nright and I'll go up and do it as and\\nand again the opening bit is always the\\nhardest like so if you can lay a new\\nbomb as your opening bit that you just\\ncame up with I love doing that that's a\\ngreat way to put yourself under pressure\\noh I love it I love it have you done\\nbottom of the barrel yet at at the\\nmothership we did it we did it last\\nnight next time you're in town on a\\nTuesday night uh Brian Simpson who we\\njust called oh were you reaching the\\nbucket yes yeah I did it last about a\\nmonth ago that's the best your back is\\nagainst the sh Shane and I did it last\\nnight for a half an hour we do it\\ntogether sometimes so Shane and I went\\nup at the end of the show oh my God we\\nhad so much fun that's it it's fun so\\nmuch fun it was so much we're we're\\nlaughing we're laughing so hard and\\nwe're I'm laughing at him we're laughing\\nat each other we're laughing at the\\naudience the audience is laughing it was\\nlike such a party because they know\\nwe're just pulling these things out yeah\\nyou pull out words right yeah you pull\\nout words you got to oh yeah so like it\\nwas cool as a team thing too cuz\\nsometimes he's ranting about something\\nwe're all laughing and I'll just while\\nhappening I'll pull in the bucket try to\\nfind another good one like what's the\\nnext one going to be so we got one on\\ndeck and so but it's like having that\\nthing where you're forced to come up\\nwith something funny in the moment it's\\nlike it's it's a good little exercise\\nfor creativity yeah and what I'm getting\\nat too is when it hits like when you you\\nknow you when you do that it's kind of\\nlike a 40 60 ratio a lot of the time 40%\\nsuccess when you get that one that you\\njust came up with and it's 100% even\\n110 they're rare but it's like oh yeah\\ndid you see the Andrew Schultz uh thing\\nthat he did about Los Angeles where he's\\nlike you know everybody's saying that\\nyou guys are a bunch of drug addicts and\\nperverts and Psychopaths but that's just\\none part of La called Diddy's house like\\ngo to this Diddy bit he came up with\\nthat in the Green Room oh see before the\\nshow yeah he they were Derek was there\\nwhile he was like like getting ready he\\nwas like trying to and Nails it yeah in\\nfront of everybody first time he did it\\nkills it's a great exercise because you\\nknow you've got the rest of your whole\\nact so in my brain I go let's go up and\\ndive on the sword see if I can you know\\nuh mine some gold and if I don't I don't\\ncuz I got 12 minutes or 30 minutes in\\nthe chamber that I know works so I just\\nI love that opening few minutes where\\nyou just like throw it out there man\\nyeah it's good it's exciting yeah just\\nputting yourself in a situation like\\nsometimes when you're on stage and\\nyou're doing a bit you ever go like in\\nan other direction just to see where it\\ngoes just take a little turn oh yeah\\njust see you never know and maybe that\\nturn becomes like the best part of the\\nbit oh absolutely but if you don't do\\nthat yeah so like that's how you tell\\nthe difference between thieves and\\nComics thieves don't they don't do that\\nlike all of a sudden they just have bits\\nyeah yeah no Switching gears in the\\nmoment is amazing and back to what\\nyou're saying about SNL that's one of\\nthe reasons I love the purity of what we\\ndo is because you can deviate you can\\ncreate your own Meandering pathway as\\nopposed to structured sketches and stuff\\nlike that it's really I don't know it's\\nit just lets you soar man yeah I mean I\\nmean you're great in sketches You're\\ngreat and dumber and dumber that was\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] awesome oh thank you that was\\nhilarious it was funny seen you in there\\ncuz like you

to send a\\nmessage to AI that we're willing to\\ncomply exactly we want to integrate\\nintegrate assimilate yeah I'm not\\ninterested in being unique I just want\\nto survive are you going to fight\\nEvolution are you really going to fight\\nthe blending mechanism of planet Earth\\noh dude the inevitable pull of the\\nuniverse towards an artificial creation\\nabut intelligent artificial creation\\nthat Superior to us I'm in exact it's\\nlike it's like resisting AI is like\\ngoing to Vegas and not gambling or going\\nto strip clubs you know it's like just\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] do it I think we are super lucky\\nto be the last people we Super Lucky we\\ngot to see what life was like with like\\nleaded gasoline and no cell phones and\\neveryone's phone was connected to a cord\\non the wall we got to go through\\nanswering machines I mean what a r if\\nthe simulation theory is real you and I\\nhave been in a crazy timeline yeah C the\\ngame we picked is real [\\xa0__\\xa0] weird FR\\nif you get in the timeline of like\\n1950 yeah to 1980 [\\xa0__\\xa0] doesn't change\\nthat much no not that much no nothing\\ncrazy no just a little bit of progress\\nbut nothing it's like relatively\\nspeaking like back then we thought it\\nwas a lot yeah we used to look at the\\n50s like look at those [\\xa0__\\xa0] dorks\\nyeah dude I mean what what I like is\\nthat the way it works or it seems like\\nit works is the planet gives you some\\nimpression you know things are going to\\nstay this way like like ler drias there\\nwere there was people hanging out and\\nthey're like it's always going to be\\nlike this and then suddenly something\\nflies through the earth atmosphere and\\nit's all gone like that in a second just\\ngone so that's the that's uh one of the\\nfascinating things is no matter what\\nperiod you live in the sun can just just\\njust burp an extra bit of plasma and\\nit's over and that's a wrap yeah that's\\na wrap for the whole planet that happens\\nall over the universe there's always\\nsomething going on like there's\\nsupernovas and volcanoes and you know\\nthat was the big uh part of the the the\\ntheory of the Anunnaki was that\\nvolcanoes had ruined their atmosphere oh\\noh and so they needed to to suspend gold\\nparticles in the atmosphere to preserve\\npreserve their Planet ecosystem is\\ngetting [\\xa0__\\xa0] up that is my favorite of\\nall the wacky conspiracy theories of all\\nthe wacky like the evolution of man tied\\nto the the reason why gold is valuable\\nto people that you know basically have\\nswords yeah you know like a sword is\\nmade of iron like that's really valuable\\nyou can kill somebody with it you can't\\ndo [\\xa0__\\xa0] with gold no but it's worth more\\nthan anything yeah yeah no that is a\\nreal suspicious thing and suspicious but\\ndo you ever like you know sometimes I'll\\nlike look at my wedding ring the gold\\nand I'll be like oh it's beautiful that\\ngold though there is something in it\\nthat's like really nice you know I don't\\nhave anything that's gold not one thing\\nwhy I don't like it what I don't like it\\nyou don't like gold nope never liked it\\nholy [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't like the way it looks\\nI don't like what it stands for I don't\\nlike gold you don't like what it stands\\nfor yeah yeah it's like it's the\\nweirdest version of this is money to me\\nthis yellow metal that's more impressive\\nthan other metals like what are you\\ntalking about like I'm not playing into\\nthat it's too stupid it's too stupid for\\nme I don't like it oh my God man I watch\\nthe [\\xa0__\\xa0] mining shows\\nlike oh I watch the mining shows too\\nthey're cool it's cool watching people\\nfind it yes I just don't want any of it\\nyou know what I'm saying dude I get gold\\nfever I watched the when I was I do when\\nI was in North Carolina I was watching\\none of those shows and I was like on\\nAmazon looking at panning equipment I'm\\nlike maybe I'll go to a\\ncreek pan for gold oh my God I could see\\nyou out there in a river I've got the\\nI've got the beard for it\\ndude shiing through did you ever see\\nthat movie sissu no oh it's one of my\\nfavorite mov movies man it's basically\\nlike what was it made in Norway who made\\nthat they Finland\\nFinland um it's basically a World War II\\nJohn Wick and it's about a guy who finds\\ngold and uh he's he's gonna he was a\\njust a killer in the Army and he's\\ngetting out of the game and uh he kills\\nlike hundreds of nais that looks awesome\\nit's [\\xa0__\\xa0] great and it's Nazis so you\\nroot for them yeah\\nyeah these are Nazis it's like the most\\ncartoonish evil Nazis oh that looks\\nincredible oh dude it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] great\\nmovie it's a great movie and very little\\ndialogue very little wow and they threw\\nin the cute dog oh yeah man of course\\nyou got to have a dog John Wick had a\\ndog John Wick had a cute little puppy\\ndude you know what's crazy like do you\\never do you follow the stuff like what\\nthey're talking about with asteroid\\nmining yes that [\\xa0__\\xa0] is crazy crazy that\\nthat's our that's you know probably a\\ncouple of generations people are going\\nto be like it won't be that long dude\\nyou know what it's going to be it's\\ngoing to be yend biological humans when\\nyou can have ai do it and you'll have ai\\nrobots that are attached to rocket ships\\nthey'll shoot them into these asteroids\\nand they'll bring back insane amounts of\\nall kinds of things\\ntitanium you know they'll find diamonds\\nin space they'll find everything holy\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] man it's not going to look\\nlike humanoids it'll be like spider\\nskittering gold spiders just [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\ndrilling their probiscus into [\\xa0__\\xa0] and\\nthen they're gonna want more money\\nthey're going to form a union cuz\\nthey're they're intelligent well yeah\\nexactly they're going to be like hey\\nwe're getting [\\xa0__\\xa0] here guys we're\\ndoing all the hard work this asshole's\\ngot a [\\xa0__\\xa0] 800 foot yacht this is\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah guys yeah wake up and then\\nthen whoever's running them like oh\\nright you guys are getting [\\xa0__\\xa0] do you\\nwant to unionize be unions what were we\\ntalking about I can't are very weird\\nright is like I've support them yeah and\\ncuz I know that big businesses [\\xa0__\\xa0] over\\ntheir workers yeah and if you allow them\\nto if you don't have laws about like how\\nmuch you can pay them and a living wage\\nand how long the hours could be people\\nwill take advantage of people anybody\\nwho thinks that those things aren't good\\nhas never worked a real [\\xa0__\\xa0] job if\\nyou work a real job for real [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nyou realize like some people will tell\\nyou hey you got to work 15 16 hours a\\nday period yeah and you get $3 an hour\\nbut I thought it was a minimum\\nyeah no no the [\\xa0__\\xa0] minimums do you want\\nthis job or not not you're going to get\\nplenty of money and you're not have time\\nto spend it anyway so don't worry about\\nit yeah yeah no the union is a nightmare\\nfor someone who's trying to make maximum\\nprofit but it's that but but the but\\nthen they go sideways too though and\\nthen they get corrupt and then something\\nhappens where look one of the things\\nthat kept the UFC out of um out of New\\nYork state was some sort of a dispute\\nthat they were having with unions\\nbecause the the people people that owned\\nthe UFC at the time they also owned\\nStation Casinos right so they owned like\\nI don't know a ton of casinos and they\\nwanted to make a union yeah so there was\\na there was a lot of that going on so\\nyou got to go like that is you you're\\nnow you're like you're manipulating\\npeople with money and influence and I\\nthink the guy who was doing it in New\\nYork wound up getting arrested and going\\nto jail for corruption if I'm TR find if\\nthat's true well dude it's like uh this\\nis this is like the model of unions is\\nperfect for like a nonviolent re\\nRevolution which is if on at a planetary\\nlevel somehow people unionized which you\\nsee it with these boycotts that pop up\\nthese meme boycotts when the collective\\ndecides to reject this thing or that\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] changes fast and this is the\\nnightmare if you're trying to create the\\nold pyramid hierarchical control\\nstructure you need all the bricks\\nunderneath the eye to to to fight each\\nother cuz the moment the moment there\\nit's just like what wait there's like\\nway more of us than you and we have way\\nmore in common than we do that we're\\ntroubled with yeah and yet they\\nconcentrate more on the [\\xa0__\\xa0] and\\nthen that's just like a [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nalgorithm on your cell phone that\\naccentuates everything comes into\\ncontact with your life exactly dude and\\nthis this is why I think at any given\\nmoment actual world peace is possible\\nbecause we're just like always like\\nenough people realizing that we're\\nbasically the same we have ideologies\\nthat are based on [\\xa0__\\xa0] like ancient\\ncrazy ideas that we're all connecting to\\nand some of parts of the ideolog is\\nbeautiful some parts of the ideology's\\nmadness and it's like just abandoning\\nsome of the ideology recognizing we're\\nall pretty much the [\\xa0__\\xa0] same and\\nthat this model of like some dude\\ntelling us to go and kill each other is\\nstupid like we don't have to do that\\neverything changes right away right away\\nyeah it's such a dumb idea such a dumb\\nidea and it's always just some withered\\nold [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude who's like just telling\\nyou to do something and you're you don't\\nyou don't even really believe in what\\nyou're doing most of the time but if you\\ndon't do it they arrest you that's the\\nthing they're like it's not really it's\\nnot like you're you're you're you're\\nfighting like any anytime there's\\nconscription you know what I mean have\\nyou seen the videos of the like Russian\\nthe people evading conscript\\nconscription or the ukrainians evading\\nconscription like it's scary they put\\nyour ass on a [\\xa0__\\xa0] bus they'll drag\\nyou out of a bar you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] hammered\\nyeah they don't even want to fight like\\nthat's the craziest part is they're like\\nmachine gunning each other and they're\\nusing people's Cannon fod literally yeah\\noh God that's so awful which is why we\\nwait the pro the real problem is like\\nthe market pressure is created by humans\\nunionizing leads to this it's like oh\\nyou guys want to unionize oh you want\\nhealth insurance well that's pretty\\nexpensive but you know what's not quite\\nas expensive Tesla Bots Tesla bot\\n[Laughter]\\nyou know I mean cuz look like if you if\\nyou look at the the path forward if for\\nthe pyramid the hierarchical people you\\nknow it's like man like yeah I I really\\ncan't tell somebody like a a a police\\nofficer to fire into a crowd of\\nprotesters they're not going to probably\\nnot gonna do that but my robot will my\\nrobot isn't GNA be like this seems wrong\\nthese people seem like me it's just\\ngoing to do it and so like that's that's\\nthe dark side of this stuff there's a\\nlot of beautiful things about this stuff\\ntoo but the dark side is like it's\\nobvious just to verify with the thing 's\\nbiggest opponent in New York found\\nguilty in federal corruption charges\\nyeah so it's true\\num yeah you know what's crazy that you\\nyou can't get the police to fire into\\ncrowds of protesters right yeah you\\ncan't do that\\nbut you also can't if you're a cop and\\nyou know bad people are in a building\\nyou can't just blow up the whole\\nbuilding but you can if it's War that's\\nwhere it gets strange right because in\\nwar you can decide that you're going to\\nyou're going to blow up entire buildings\\nbecause you know the bad guys are in\\nthere and anybody else is just\\ncollateral damage so extra dead people\\nare just C can you imagine if started\\npracticing police work like that like\\nimagine imagine if they decided that the\\nthe crime rates in gang infested\\nneighborhoods are too bad so they're\\ngoing to send in [\\xa0__\\xa0] Black Ops guys\\nto just take out drug dealers and blow\\nup houses houses that have drug dealers\\nin them you're with your mom tough [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nboom everybody's dead you have a little\\ngirl in the house boom everybody's dead\\ncould you imagine well you can because\\nyou watch Israel and Palestine that's\\nwhat's going on it's just like you're\\nallowed to do that if it's countries\\nwhich is crazy yeah well you you like\\nyeah exact so the idea is like okay\\nlet's just say I'm an e I'm an evil\\ncountry and I I program these robot dogs\\nand the robot dogs or spiders are more\\nSinister robot spiders razor [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nrazor claws they're programmed to only\\nkill women and children so I release\\nthem into a city they leave leave\\neveryone alone except babies kids and\\nwomen uh on a planetary level people be\\nlike we have to evaporate that country\\nlike they're the most evil country\\nthat's horrible now if I take drones and\\ndrop them on buildings and they randomly\\nblow up women and children in ways that\\nare predominantly predominantly in ways\\nthat are maybe even worse than my\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] razor spiders my Razor spiders\\nthey go for the juggler puncture juggler\\nonto the next juggler vein the bombs\\nthey maim they blind they cause\\npermanent brain damage and\\nsomehow that is looked at as yeah it's\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] War dude that's what it looks\\nlike it's so crazy that because it's\\nexisted for the longest time we just\\naccept it that it's always going to take\\nplace and then we also if like you had a\\ngamble if you had a gamble whether or\\nnot war would be here in 10 years you\\nlike 100% it's going to be here well\\nwell this is unless AI takes over well I\\nmean if AI takes over it'll just be more\\nefficient War I don't know if it will\\ndude if if it communicates in a\\ndifferent way like what if AI makes\\nrational decisions that can only be\\nreached like if if if you if you were\\nlooking outside of human emotions and\\ncultures and all all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] and and\\ncultural differences that we have with\\neach other if AI I bypassed all of that\\nand just looked at the problem as you\\nknow you have resources you have\\nallocation of those resources people\\nprofiting off those resources and then\\npeople who are in need that be are being\\ntaken advantage of to acquire those\\nresources and that's your whole game and\\nso if this is the human rac's whole game\\nyou're willing to sacrifice this group\\nof people that is the least powerful in\\norder to empower all of your\\nelectronics this is this is what you're\\ndoing this is what you're agreeing to\\nthis whole thing is crazy and it would\\nprobably\\nrestructure where and how things were\\nAcquired and who gets those things that\\nare acquired from the ground yeah I mean\\nthis is okay so this would be utopian AI\\nyeah but before we get to utopian AI we\\nhave to go through what is h did you see\\nthose new the the Chinese military put\\nmachine guns on those [\\xa0__\\xa0] robot dogs\\nhave you seen that I did they [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\ndid it we all knew that was going to\\nhappen and did you see the [\\xa0__\\xa0] cute\\nDARPA dog have you seen that yet no dude\\nso like I it's DARPA right they're the\\nones who make the dogs they kick the\\nrobots they make videos of like [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\npoking these things well so the dogs are\\nSinister everyone knows that they look\\ncreepy so DARPA is like you know let's\\nmake a cute one of these things so they\\nmade like a cute amusement park I got to\\nsee this Disneyland style [\\xa0__\\xa0] robot\\ndog and it looks creepier it's going to\\nshoot you it's creep no cuz this is this\\nis what I've been thinking about we\\npicture the Terminator as the machine of\\ndeath but why what is like more\\ndangerous than an adorable kid what if I\\ncan make an an Android toddler looks\\nexactly like a toddler send that toddler\\nout in the battlefield everyone's going\\nto stop firing why is there a [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nkid out here\\nright and the kid's killing everybody\\nand and just they're like go get that\\nkid and it just [\\xa0__\\xa0] punches right\\nthrough your heart also small Target\\nhard to shoot hard to shoot it can\\nburrow into the ground it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nburrowing\\ntoddler cork screws it to the ground\\nlike a missile it just like just it just\\ngoes down and just [\\xa0__\\xa0] like like on\\nall four shoots through the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nBattlefield deploying poison darts it's\\nlike so cuz I imagine a little baby that\\ncould run 100 miles hour exactly exact\\ncuz that's the future of War man it's\\nlike why make something that looks\\nscary this is the cute one no this is\\nthe [\\xa0__\\xa0] no this isn't the cute that\\nain't cute boy it's creepy look at how\\nit's it's bar it's like it's moving its\\nmouth yeah what is it doing with its\\nmouth is it going to bite you just I\\nwonder if it can bite you it's just\\ncursing there's got to be one that could\\nbite you right right well of course why\\nnot I mean that would be the most\\nterrifying thing like a robot wolf that\\nruns around and chases people down and\\nactually tears you apart with his teeth\\nbayonets you know man you got to have\\nthe [\\xa0__\\xa0] knife on your we on your\\nweapon if you get in a close combat\\nthere you go little blender mouth what\\nis it doing it's GNA get your dick look\\nhow it did that look like it did that\\nlike it was right it was going to jump\\nright on your dick on your\\ndick it's a Dicky to robot it turns the\\nDick Energy China developed a dick eater\\nrobot can you imagine that's what it\\nlooks like it's doing what else is it\\ndoing look at the motion it makes it\\nleaps forward imagine [\\xa0__\\xa0] send\\npeople out of the battlefield that get\\nshot and then you let loose the dick\\neating robots and oh no you see the\\nrobots running and they just leap on\\nyour dick and blend it up it's worse in\\nthe atomic bomb it's the it's like\\nthey're saying you are [\\xa0__\\xa0] there's no\\nhope we're going to blend your dick\\noff dude I I poured a whole cup of\\ncoffee then I'm like oh\\nyeah I I'm I'm fine taking off the\\nhelmet of these [\\xa0__\\xa0] things we can\\nhang in there a little longer just so\\nyou know it's like my beard is if I'm\\ntalking weird it's because like there's\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] pubic hair shoving it's

tapping\\nyou know like when you're like uh wait\\nwhere's the\\nzipper that'd be [\\xa0__\\xa0] crazy if these\\nthings locked down okay here we go yeah\\nI just you know but now it's so fun man\\nand there's so much you could do with\\nlike video that you just can't do with\\naudio it's just fun yeah it's way better\\nand I like editing like that's the\\nproblem like I like that's the problem\\nis I I get lost\\nediting oh Jesus Christ oh Jesus Christ\\nthat sucked you need help no that I\\nthink I think that's\\naoo oh I think that's the longest we've\\never kept our our mask on yeah that was\\nthe longest that was a good solid like\\nhalf hour this feels so\\ngood about half hour was it 20 minutes\\n20 20\\nplus being stoned in any kind of mask is\\nlike extra scary extra [\\xa0__\\xa0] furry\\nones we we made it like 3 minutes with\\nthe furry masks on we're like this is\\ncrazy and now whenever I see furries\\nrespect deep respect for they're tough\\nas [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh they have to be if you're out\\nthere and you you're furing it up and\\nit's in Louisiana in July yeah come on\\nson dude yeah you are like hot furries\\nare like David goggin's level like they\\ncould run marathons if you can wear that\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] thing at a convention and\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] it you could run a marathon if\\nyou're wearing that thing all day you're\\nbasically walking around with a weight\\npack on oh yeah you like a weighted vest\\nit's a weighted [\\xa0__\\xa0] claustrophobic\\nSuffocation vest that you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] in\\nyeah they [\\xa0__\\xa0] on them I wonder how many\\nfurries develop bad necks I wonder if\\nit's an issue in the furry community\\nmaybe that's like an unserved market for\\num the iron neck yeah like the FES and\\nhelp them iron neck for FES give me that\\nso we oh yeah hey Jamie can you find\\nthat cute DARPA dog I was looking for it\\nit's like the furry of War robots you\\nshould like you it will you found it is\\nthat real yeah that's real I watched I\\nmean I think it's real I watched it if\\nwho says it's no that's not it that's\\nnot it it's like um is it not DARPA it's\\nlike uh I think if if you just Google\\nlike cute DARPA dog or like it's a video\\nof the maybe it's not DARPA maybe\\nsomeone else developed it yeah sometimes\\nI get confused probably Chinese no it's\\nnot DARPA it's they're going to fill the\\npounds with them please take me home\\n[Music]\\nplease dude that's so Insidious it's\\nlike the cutest rescue dog and it's\\nyou're like we have to take that and it\\ndoesn't kill you it just emits some kind\\nof weird mind control pheromone that\\nreally injects Tik Tok into your [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nhead it just like you know so you fully\\nabsorb Tik tok's manipulation which by\\nthe way I was skeptical about that uh\\nuntil we talked about this I saw that\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] video showing the comments in\\nTik Tok are different it exact I think\\nit's Instagram it's the one I saw is Tik\\nTok oh okay the one was it on Tik Tok\\ncuz the one I saw was Instagram it was\\nthis lady that was doing it with her\\nboyfriend and they were both looking at\\nthe same thing but had different\\ncomments\\nyes her comments were mocking the man\\nand the comments on his side was mocking\\nthe woman yes right yes so am I getting\\nthat right you got it right and so\\nwhenever I'm looking at comments I make\\nthe idiot mistake of thinking this\\nrepresents some consensus that you know\\nbut actually no you're just looking at\\nthe the the algorithm serving the\\ncomments and the content that is so\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] up dude that's so different dude\\nbecause that changes the the comments\\nare supposed to be a conversation about\\nthe thing so if you're curating the\\nconversation in an unnatural way yes\\nlike that's very different than showing\\nme what I want to see yes because now\\nyou're changing the Dynamics of how\\nthings are discussed yes sir that's the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] evil right there that's the evil\\nThat's crazy dude this so and then okay\\nthe other assumption with the algorithm\\nis that the algorithm is just like\\nrandom or it's using some set of\\nvariables and serving things up but this\\nis an idiot assumption I mean you could\\nif you are controlling comments then\\nthat means like all right let's just\\nlike make people mad at each other let's\\nmake people completely pissed at each\\nother as much as possible convey this\\nidea that there's like these massive\\ndivides between us and then then they're\\ngoing to fight each other instead of\\nrecognizing they're pretty much the same\\nlike or they're more nuanced than they\\nthink they are and [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude that's how\\nyou control populations it's brilliant\\nit's brilliant dude it's but do you\\nthink that it is is it is their\\nalgorithm created and and utilized to\\ncontrol populations or is there\\nalgorithm simply to get you to engage so\\nit must see that you engage with a\\ncertain number of comments and posts\\nthat have a lean one way or another but\\nthere's a very popular thing that's\\ngoing on right now that you see a lot of\\nand it's like very Stern men talking to\\na bunch of like girl influencers and\\ntelling them they're [\\xa0__\\xa0] losers yes\\nit's it's really common yeah so if\\nyou've seen one or two of those it\\nstarts recommending more of at a certain\\npoint in time it's going to probably\\nactually encourage other people to do\\nthe same thing because that creates\\nengagement and then you have this thing\\nthat emerges like was this a real thing\\nlike who's doing this like what is\\nhappening here why is this why is this a\\nnew thing that's happening over and over\\nand over again and it's just because you\\nengaged with it and I think that could\\nbe slap fighting or it could be [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nfor me it's like I see so many car\\naccidents oh my God so many motorcycle\\naccidents so many people falling off\\nbridges yeah I see so much of it cuz\\nI've engaged with it too many times yeah\\ndude I when I F when I went on Tik Tok\\nand I I I stopped cuz it's like too good\\nit but like it like within a seconds\\nit's just like something about the way I\\nwas looking at videos zit popping videos\\nit's just like you like to watch zits\\npop and then of course when you're\\nseeing that you're like wow that's\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] intense dude let me watch some\\nmore of these now that's that Dr pimple\\npopper lady she's got a a huge side of\\nit yeah and she's very ENT entertaining\\nwhen she's talking absolutely but some\\nof them are like whoa dude it's like you\\nhave cream cheese in your body a bucket\\nof it oh my God they just squirting it\\nout it's like how is that in there what\\nis oh my God it must be horrible [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nstinks just all those dead blood cells\\nbut dude you this is like for for me\\nI've had to after seeing that video I've\\nhad to like go back and just erase any\\nidea I have about a consensus among\\npeople cuz like I've been drawing that\\nidea from comment section like oh I\\nguess this is what people think or like\\nrotten tomatoes dude I just saw Civil\\nWar all right have you seen it no don't\\nnow apologies I mean this man because\\nanyone who makes anything that's insane\\nif you made a movie it's [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nincredible but dude I was so excited\\nabout that [\\xa0__\\xa0] movie it's like whoa\\npredictive programming baby they're\\ngetting us ready for a civil [\\xa0__\\xa0] War\\nhere we go it is you can't connect to\\nany of the [\\xa0__\\xa0] characters you don't\\nyou barely understand who the\\nprotagonist is it's the dumbest mission\\nof all time that they're on this there's\\nno no there's and the soundtrack is so\\nmysteriously disconnected from what's\\nHappening so there's all these things\\nthat just m make no it's like if like if\\nthey sent me the footage and they like\\nDuncan can you edit this movie I would\\nhave made Civil War like what\\nI be like let's put some [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nhardcore weird like synth music we'll\\nput the silver apples in there really\\nintense synth music cuz I love synth\\nmusic and you're watching it like is\\nthis a music video for synth\\nmusic what what am I what do I [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nseeing here dude so I'm now I want to\\nsee it no it's it's worth seeing it just\\nbecause it's it's like you know\\nespecially if you're into like writing\\nscreenplays it's good to watch movies\\nlike that and be like why did why isn't\\nthis working like what's wrong here but\\ndude I went to Rotten Tomatoes gleefully\\nlike G I can't wait to hear what people\\nare saying about this piece of [\\xa0__\\xa0] 81%\\npeople are like this is a good warning\\nto all of us it's like shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nup a warning what are you talking about\\nit's a it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] warning not to\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] do the $20 still in theaters\\nthing on Amazon that's the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nwarning don't don't do that\\nwait dude it's suck it sucks none of it\\nmakes sense the stereotypical [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\ncharacters in it the way they're trying\\nto like box people into this like\\nthey're all evil the these people all\\nwhat kind of American are you\\nNorth American South American you're\\nfrom Hong Kong Bam Bam Bam stop it just\\nshut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up like no one's like that\\nlike really like I'm not obviously\\npeople are like vile racists but dude\\ncome on this murder this I hate this\\nassessment of humanity I because\\nbasically what they're saying is minus\\nthe [\\xa0__\\xa0] Capstone of the pyramid\\nwe're just going to kill each other cuz\\nwe're awful brutal things that must be\\nshephered by old geriatric men who can't\\nremember their [\\xa0__\\xa0] name you know\\nwhat like what are we doing like we'll\\nbe fine we're fine we'll be okay people\\nare mostly nice and what's that thing\\nyou always say I love it unmet\\nneeds yeah what how what is the actual\\nquote again Jamie all criticism is the\\ntragic result of unmet needs but it's a\\nmuch more profound quote the full quote\\nI forget who wrote it too it's really I\\nshouldn't forget because I use it all\\nthe time it's a great quote cuz it's\\nthat is what like I mean there's\\ncriticism that's accurate like something\\nwasn't good every criticism judgment\\ndiagnosis and expression of anger is the\\ntragic expression of an unmet need\\nMarshall Rosenberg yeah yeah great\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] quote Yeah so it's like yeah\\nthere are people who are [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] who are doing [\\xa0__\\xa0] that\\ndisrupts so Society in small ways and\\nbig ways but they're not doing that cuz\\nthey're evil I don't think they're doing\\nthat because like they they've learned\\nthis way of being that sucks now I'm not\\nsaying throw out the judicial system\\nthey shouldn't be you know jails or\\nanything like that I'm just saying this\\nnotion of humanity minus an\\nauthoritarian generally [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\npatriarchal [\\xa0__\\xa0] like whatever but I\\ndon't care if it's matriarchal whatever\\nit is top down [\\xa0__\\xa0] ruling system\\nwithout the king we will just fall on\\neach other give me your [\\xa0__\\xa0] car\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] some of us will do that but\\nguess what they won't last that long\\nbecause like in in a collectivized\\nsociety I just feel like like we'll take\\ncare of the problems quick probably\\nquicker than we do right now and\\neverything will balance out if we're\\narmed the problem is if you're not armed\\nthen armed thugs take over towns and you\\ncan't do anything to stop and you're in\\na small group of people that are unarmed\\nand they're they're pushed into certain\\nsituations if you if you have a collapse\\nof Law and Order it's not as simple as\\nwe'll take care of it the real problem\\nis sometimes armed thugs rule everything\\nthis is true yeah and that's that's a\\nreality of humanity in 2024 like in\\ncertain parts of the world like did you\\nhear about what happened in Haiti oh\\ndude with that Minister his family dude\\nyeah and the guy that that war Lord in\\nHaiti oh yeah I love watching interviews\\nwith that guy what is his name again\\nit's got a cool name it's like sandwich\\nit's like I can't barue or something\\nbarbecue\\nbarbecue it's like sandwich and there\\nwas uh there's this one video but it's\\nnot really it's not really of him\\nsomeone said it was of him but I guess\\nit's not I think and it's a guy uh\\neating a guy so it's one of these Rebels\\nthat has this dude killed roasting over\\na fire and takes a piece off his leg\\nThat's a classic move that's like a\\nclassic move you get their energy by\\neating them and look I'm not saying that\\nthat that there isn't contingence of\\nlike super violent people that you are\\ngoing to have to be able to defend\\nyourself from and by the way what's\\nreally perplexing to me about the\\nhardcore anti-gun people is they're not\\nreally anti-gun they\\nwant Cops and the National Guard to have\\nguns they just don't want people that\\nlike people who live in houses to have\\nguns so they're like you they're pro gun\\nbut they want guns in the hands of like\\nthey're Pro authoritarian violent power\\nyeah that's it authoritarians have power\\nregular people don't have power right so\\nyou have to rely on author the\\nauthoritarians you have to rely on them\\nto take care of your crime issues yeah\\nsee I I think I would have more respect\\nfor that movement if they're like no\\nmore guns anywhere we're going to get\\nrid of all the guns in the world\\nand melt them and melt them and just I\\ndon't know build a [\\xa0__\\xa0] a water slide\\nor something but no more hunting you get\\nto hit things with bows and arrows rocks\\ntraps traps knives knives theys you can\\nstill hunt deer but you have to use a\\nknife\\nyeah [\\xa0__\\xa0] you imagine how many dudes\\nwould get really good at like hiding in\\ntrees and droing down and stabbing deer\\ndude it would be amazing like I you I\\nmight get into hunting like if it\\nbe [\\xa0__\\xa0] throw up a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dagger\\nthere's a dude that films uh Pig hunts\\nand he uses Spears and he hides in trees\\nlike above the pigs and then he has like\\na camera on the spear and he throws the\\nspear down and stabs these wild pigs wow\\nit's pretty wild what I would love to\\nknow the first time he did that like I\\nwould love to yeah how many times you\\nhow do you practice that just but the\\nlead you're just like what you're you're\\nlike driving you're like dude what if I\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] used a spear if I climbed in a\\ntree and started spearing pigs the thing\\nabout pigs is there's so many of them\\nthey'll do any you're allowed to do\\nalmost anything to get rid of them in\\nTexas at least they they've hunt them\\nout helicopters have you ever seen that\\nno I've been invited three times I'm\\nlike I I'm not getting a helicopter\\ndon't get helicopter with machine guns\\non top of that with pigs it's just if I\\nfeel like if I'm going to shoot a pig I\\nwant to eat the pig and if I'm gonna\\nshoot 250 pigs there's no way I'm eating\\n250 pigs yeah dude just yeah if I shoot\\none pig that pig will get eaten will\\nmake some barbecue out of that pig it'\\nbe awesome but if you shoot two I mean I\\nget it you have to do it though this is\\nthe other part of it if you run a farm\\nyou have to do it they'll kill your\\nprofit they the profit margin of\\nAmerican farmers is so low as it is it's\\nso difficult for them to to make money\\nthat if you got a million wild pigs\\nrunning around your state or more Texas\\nhas how many Millions isn't it like 3\\nmillion which is bananas if you know\\nanything about like wild animal numbers\\nthat's so crazy to have that many\\nanimals in a state that are just wild\\nferal animals 2.6 from this is from six\\n2016 it says the same thing here says it\\nbut now in 2023 an estimate still they\\ndon't know feral Hogs they really don't\\nknow but at least 2.6 or range of 2.6\\nthere's no way you could you would\\nactually have to like use drones at\\nnight fly over areas monitor how many\\ntimes they breed they breed three times\\na year dude yeah they can start breeding\\nwhen they're six months old whoa yeah so\\nsix months old and then they have three\\nlit a year and they'll have five six\\npiglets in a litter and they're just\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] now babies and then they're just\\ndrawing everything they're just running\\nthrough the ground tearing up [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\ngolf courses and people's lawns in San\\nJose have you ever seen the San Jose\\nvideos no San Jose California wild pigs\\njust tearing apart people's [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nLawns wow knocking over trash cans big\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] terrifying [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude one of them\\nkilled a lady what yeah somewhere I\\nforget where it was it might have been\\nout here I think this lady F saw the\\npigs fell down in her driveway and they\\njust [\\xa0__\\xa0] tore her AP part dude what\\nwho was that I just watched this like\\nCrime Files thing about this psychopath\\nwho had pigs and she would have people\\ncome and work for her and then if they\\npissed her off she throw them to the\\npigs and the pigs like and someone was\\nsaying when I'm if you're walking around\\nthe pigs you better not fall cuz if you\\nfall down they'll just [\\xa0__\\xa0] eat you\\nthat's like the number one way people\\nget killed by animals on farms it's pig\\neat\\nyou one woman's death by feral hog may\\nnot have been caused by the animal after\\nall medical examiner determined that\\nphoh hog killed Christine Rollins but\\nher daughter is skeptical because\\nattacks by the animal are extremely rare\\nwait a minute the [\\xa0__\\xa0] medical EXA\\nthis is what a confusing headline said\\none woman's death by feral hog might not\\nhave been caused by the animal after all\\nbut the medical examiner said it was\\ncaused by the wild hog but the daughter\\nis saying attacks by the animal are\\nextremely rare well will believe the\\ndaughter the daughter who is the\\ndaughter the daughter could be doing\\nanything haven't you seen Charlotte's\\nWeb haven't you these pigs would never\\nwhat is the daughter saying I don't\\nunderstand I mean why does she think\\nthat because they they do [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\neverything up like especially if you\\nfall down foxo says attacks by feral\\nHogs are extremely rare less than one in\\na million chance according to research\\ndata that's why some are now suspicious\\nthat her cause of death was really due\\nto an attack by the animal what what\\nwhat's more dog suspicious that her\\ncause of death was really due to uh to\\nan attack by the animal rather sorry\\nwhat's more dogs were found lingering\\naround rollin's body after her death\\nthere's really no doubt that Hogs got to\\nher body at some point the question is\\nwhether the hog oh might she be killed\\nby dogs whether something else caused\\nher to die and the Hogs came along right\\nthat's possible that's totally possible\\nsure it's definitely possible but it how\\nold was this lady 59 59 that pig looks\\nsuspicious as [\\xa0__\\xa0] man it depends on\\nlike what kind of 59y old lady you're\\ntalking about you talk about a lady who\\ngoes to CrossFit or you're talking about\\na lady who's 59 and has diabetes cuz\\nlike if you fall down around wild pigs\\nlike I got to think they're going to\\ntreat you the same way domestic pigs do\\nif domestic pigs start eating you if you\\nfall into the pig pen there's a crazy\\nstory I heard about a kid that raised a\\nhog that went at just one day turned on\\nhim like he he raised it his entire life\\nit was like his pet like my dog is\\neverywhere with him and then one day he\\nsaid he tripped in the pen and it just\\nattacked him it almost killed him oh my\\nGod I forget it was a crazy story I\\nforget even where I saw but it's just\\npopping in my head now like I just say\\nhorrible way to die bro could you\\nimagine getting eaten alive by a pig no\\nno that's squeal but wouldn't we have it\\ncoming how much bacon have you eaten a\\nlot I've eaten a lot of bacon a lot I've\\neaten a lot of bacon I love this is\\nwhere the vegans get really excited oh\\nboy I'm going to get a lot of cute pig\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] pictures vegans need to hear\\nthat lettuce SC scream they should hear\\nit scream it screams screams let screams\\nyeah all of it screams avocados scream\\nhis best friend was a 250b warthog oh\\nit's a warthog a little bigger but yeah\\noh well it's an African animal it's a\\ndifferent animal I don't think that's I\\nmean I think that's like a distant\\ncousin to a pig they look different\\nthey're crazy looking you ever seen a w\\nw hog no bro they got like these crazy\\ndouble tusks look at it look at that\\nthing [\\xa0__\\xa0] that in that\\nlook at his tusks oh this is my friend\\nyeah the that dude is not your friend\\nhe's incapable that's a wild beast that\\nis so much different than a guy raising\\na hog like if that guy raised a pig the\\npig would probably never do that that\\nthing is a wild animal yeah where was\\nthis Texas like on their family ranch\\nthe story about like how so crazy I\\nforget how so crazy out here he called\\nthe house and someone knew what was\\nhappening awesome it's awesome to be in\\na place where you could own a wild\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] warthog dude Texas like my wife\\nand I talk about this all the time we're\\nnever leaving we we're like this is home\\nwe love it so much man it's what America\\naspires to be dude it is and like people\\nare so mad at us and people [\\xa0__\\xa0] about\\nit and make but it's like man I love it\\nhere so much and I like the Heat and I\\nand and like weirdly all of us are like\\nwe're like getting healthy man like at\\nlike it's this CRA i' in all the years\\nat The Comedy Store lots of changes\\nhappened among the comics like the time\\nI hope I can talk about this I think I\\ncan he talks about it like remember like\\nhe does talk about Bobby Lee talks about\\nit publicly like the time Bobby Lee was\\nlike on pills oh yeah he talks about so\\nhe would bring all of these pills to The\\nComedy Store and we all knew it and so\\nhe was like a pharmacist so like like\\nJoey Joey watching Joey just like grab a\\nhandful of just unknown Mexican [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nPharmaceuticals this is pre fental dog\\npre fental you could do those things\\nback then dude and and and so that that\\nwas I would call that a dark phase in\\nThe Comedy Store because all of us were\\non Bobby Le [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] Mexican Viking\\nit was a bad face so so but I don't\\nthink I've ever seen a phase where like\\nat a comedy club the comics are getting\\nhealthier you know that's a crazy thing\\nto watch and I I think you know it's not\\njust us hanging out when I first came to\\nTexas and I'm not saying everyone's here\\nis healthy or any kind of [\\xa0__\\xa0] like\\nthat but you look around like these\\npeople are [\\xa0__\\xa0] healthy like there's\\na lot of healthy like you know what I\\nmean like like tough [\\xa0__\\xa0] people and\\na lot of people who exercise yeah just\\ngo to the lake watch people run around\\nthe lake dude in the like in the middle\\nof a\\nheatwave before I was exercising one of\\nthe most like humiliating things was\\njust to be driving on the street and you\\nlook over and there's someone my age\\nit's 104° and they're [\\xa0__\\xa0] jogging\\nand you know what I mean like what's\\nyour excuse again oh you TI are you\\nsleepy is a little too [\\xa0__\\xa0] hot cuz\\nthere's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] 55-year-old there's a\\n55-year-old just Galloping down the\\nburning [\\xa0__\\xa0] sidewalk yeah so yeah\\ndude this place is like sidewalk run is\\na different kind of hot too cuz you're\\ngetting that heat radiating off of the\\nconcrete into your face you know Lex\\nFreeman does that [\\xa0__\\xa0] oh yeah he's a\\npsycho he [\\xa0__\\xa0] runs like when I did\\nhis podcast he's like I'm going jogging\\nI'm like what are you talking about like\\nI this was in my like Early Texas face\\nso I was already like I walked from my\\ncar to his place and was already like\\nJesus [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nChrist\\nwalking and he's like yeah I'm going to\\ngo jog 10 miles I'm like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nare you man in this heat yeah dude yeah\\nit's so I think it's important to be\\naround like I think that's another\\naspect of Texas that gets left out is\\nlike there's this there's this real like\\nstrength healthy thing here that is\\ncontagious whereas like when you're in a\\nplace where everyone's all [\\xa0__\\xa0] sick\\nand frail and weak and like you know\\nwhat I mean scared of disease like\\ntrembling in their [\\xa0__\\xa0] boots that's\\ncontagious too it is jumps into you man\\nit 100% does and I always wonder like\\nhow much of you know how much of an area\\nhas the memory of all the things that\\nhave happened in that area in it and\\nlike whereas Texas was the last state to\\nenter into the Union they've always been\\nlike hang the [\\xa0__\\xa0] back hold on you know\\nwe we had to get through the command\\nshei to establish this [\\xa0__\\xa0] place\\nlike settle down the you know Texas\\nRangers had to go out there in cold camp\\nand go and try to assassinate these\\nbands of [\\xa0__\\xa0] Killers riding horses\\nthat were just [\\xa0__\\xa0] up the Americans\\nlike they couldn't pass they couldn't\\npass they couldn't get through this was\\nthe spot where it was like this place\\nwas [\\xa0__\\xa0] and until they conquered it\\nit stayed [\\xa0__\\xa0] and then they did and\\nnow it's the whole place has a memory of\\nthat yes there's a there's a there's a\\nthing about the attitude of this place\\nyeah dude it's but it's it's not what\\npeople think like people think they're\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] they are the nicest friendliest\\npeople people think they're stupid they\\nare some brilliant people that I've met\\nthat live out here brilliant normal\\npeople one of my neighbor\\nwas a Texas Ranger and he is the coolest\\nguy and you know he's an older guy now\\nhe's retired but and he's still\\nintimidating and um yeah man like he\\nlike he like uh he's the like he's so\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] cool man and like and and he I'm\\ntrying not to give away to respecting\\nhis privacy uh\\nhe every once in a while in the\\nneighborhood we would hear this boom\\nsounds like a exploding and like um it's\\nhis Cannon he's got like a little\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] Cannon and like he like he likes\\na cannon in his yard oh it's little but\\nlike so so what's he shooting at well he\\ndoesn't put cannonballs in it there's a\\nway to do it so like my kid like one day\\npulls up in front of my house with a\\ntruck it's like one of my kids birth\\nlike it just had a birthday and he's\\nlike do they want to see the cannon and\\nI'm like I do I know I do and so like it\\nwas like the coolest thing ever man he\\ntakes his [\\xa0__\\xa0] can little little\\nCannon I'm looking at it I'm like that\\ncan't be\\nallowed you know what I mean he takes\\nthis little Cannon he does some crazy\\nlike pirate [\\xa0__\\xa0] with it that I still\\ndon't understand he's like knows how to\\noperate a\\ncannon boom my kids were like holy [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nmy neighbors ran into the yard cuz they\\nthought something had happened well\\nDuncan you've shot guns before yeah\\nthink about how little gunpowder is in\\nright like a a 9 mimer right it's not a\\nlot right it's crazy loud right you're\\nright it's just contained by that Barrel\\nwell yeah right and so a Canon shooting\\nout that that gas and that bullet but\\nit's it's basically like the little\\nCannon is kind of the same thing well it\\ntotally made me like you know it gave me\\na new picture of like Cannon battles on\\nships bro imagine how loud that was I\\nmean imagine how loud that was like real\\ncannons yeah dude like I've been to a\\nfootball game when they shoot off a\\ncannon but I don't know if that was like\\na real Canon Cannon you know like\\nprobably probably like the UNLV what do\\nthey use I mean not not UNLV um\\nyeah\\nUNLV I blame the\\nweed um dude the like the UT one do they\\nhave um it's called smoke Canon it's a\\nrecreation of a civil war Cannon a civil\\nwar Jesus hey guys let it go yeah maybe\\nrecreate an earlier Cannon guys how\\nabout you can do a [\\xa0__\\xa0] pirate Cannon\\nyeah do a pirate\\nCanon which side bro it says it fires\\nfour shotgun shells after every TCH\\nthat's crazy oh so that's what it does\\nit does shotgun shells 10 gauge blank\\nshotgun shells okay okay so I guess\\nthat's probably not the sound of an\\nactual C look at that look at that crazy\\nthat's a happy Cannon man yeeha it's\\nreally loud but the point is I wonder\\nlike to shoot a cannonball like at a\\nship back then like how much gunpowder\\nthey use and how [\\xa0__\\xa0] loud was that\\nand how deaf were those [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nthe dudes who had to work the Cannons\\ndeaf deaf as [\\xa0__\\xa0] deaf as [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude and\\nhow much brain damage you get just\\nstanding next to that thing\\nboom going off The Recoil well if you\\ndon't get out of the way it will [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nrip your leg off God man yeah that thing\\nis flying back right didn't they have\\nhim on tracks yeah man yeah they it will\\nlike um so it doesn't rip out of the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] floor didn't they have like\\ncannons on tracks I I just saw this make\\nthat up that's probably how they just\\nmoved them no I thought they were on\\ntracks like so that when they shot they\\nwould slide back and not rip the floor\\napart I just saw that John Adams doc on\\nNetflix I think it's on Netflix I don't\\nknow what it's that what it's on but\\nthere was like a Cannon battle\\nin in a ship and like yeah a dude just\\ngets his [\\xa0__\\xa0] leg ripped off cuz it\\nlike back it like goes back into him\\nit's dude isn't it crazy that that seems\\ncrazy to us but like how many people\\ndied in Cannon battles as opposed to\\nlike when Israel bombs Gaza dude like\\nhow many people I mean like a bomb which\\nwe do right now it seems so much more\\nbrutal than Cannon battles like Cannon\\nbattles seem like really ineffective\\nit's probably they probably sucked yeah\\nlike how far did that Cannonball go like\\nhow good were they at judging it here we\\ngo this is what a Cannon's\\nlike\\ndamn yeah see how it slides back it's on\\nWheels yep and then there's a rope that\\ncatches it yeah dude dude what a imagine\\nlife back then and they thought that was\\nthe [\\xa0__\\xa0] that was like a [\\xa0__\\xa0] iPhone\\n16 bro I got a Canon yeah you know we\\nused to be able to used to have to go up\\nto the boat jump in hack everybody to\\ndeath light it on fire now I think it\\nyou shoot it from over here incredible\\nyou don't even have to jump on the boat\\namazing yes yeah man I'll tell you\\nthough with all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that's going on\\nright\\nnow I know everyone's freaked out but\\nthe reason I'm\\nhopeful is not because of like the\\nbombings and the deaths obviously it's\\nthe outcry like like when in history has\\nthere been this level of outcry like no\\nwhat are you doing stop like to me like\\nthat's the sign that human consciousness\\nis like evolving to to Value life in a\\nway that maybe we didn't value before\\nbecause like there there have been\\ninfinite Wars and like including like\\nthe how many people did we [\\xa0__\\xa0] bomb\\nhow many people how many civilians did\\nwe [\\xa0__\\xa0] kill when we were [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nbombing uh Iraq how many no I there's a\\nit's a lot right well they don't know\\nlike the full number you you get two\\ndifferent people's numbers but they\\nthink that it's somewhere in the\\nneighborhood of a million people died\\nright so so in that right is that is\\nthat correct is that I think it's also\\nlike deaths that they attribute to\\nthings that happen because of the war\\nbut I think it led to a million innocent\\ndeaths or somewhere in that range I\\nthink that was the high end but and in\\nthere was an outcry over that war but\\nnot the same as this but yeah but right\\nif you think about the numbers like yeah\\nI think it's also the access that we\\nhave now to cell phone footage and how\\ngood it is and how quickly it gets\\nposted I that's relatively recently you\\nknow yeah like that's the real abilities\\nof these phones like to make videos like\\nthey do now how long has that been going\\non you're right 10 years you're right\\nyou know\\n100 100,000 including civilians 66,000\\ncivilians\\n210,211\\n19,000 deaths including\\n66081 civilian that's weird I don't\\nunderstand what they're saying\\nthere what's that it just pulled that\\nsection from the middle of this whole\\nthing civilian deaths from violence does\\nthat mean War like what does that mean\\nso that's civilians that were killed\\nentirely by war or is that civilians\\nthat died just from violence well any\\nkind of violence yeah like stabbing your\\nneighbor but this is like Carlin does\\njokes about this this is what's really\\nInsidious about this [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's like it's\\nWar yeah say it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] War it's like\\nit's like the violence it's the the\\nviolence is related to war so don't say\\nfrom violence say from [\\xa0__\\xa0] War\\nbecause that's what war does and you\\nknow it's really crazy looking\\nat dead human numbers go put that back\\nup please when you're looking at the\\nnumber\\n[Music]\\n210,211 10,000\\n296 people that didn't have to die how\\nmany memories that died because someone\\nwanted to do something and got a group\\nof people to go and do their bidding and\\nthey all were uh they all were\\nauthorized to shoot people yeah man yeah\\nthis is a crazy thing that we still do\\nas human beings and the problem is I\\ndon't see a way out of it because\\nterrorists are real criminals are real\\nbad people are real this is the world\\nwe're living in unless\\nyou take mushrooms we got to get\\nmushrooms legal for the entire country\\nthe whole country yeah and just force\\nthem down everybody's throat force\\npeople to do mushrooms do it for\\neveryone else that's our robots do for\\neveryone else our robot [\\xa0__\\xa0] like\\nlike like like a bird it just pokes its\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] thing in your mouth and sprays\\ncybin in there can you imagine if AI\\nforced us all to take till ayin oh what\\na horrible day that would be but you\\nimagine if like that was AI solution\\nyeah was like human beings actually\\ndeveloped their Consciousness through\\nthis sort of relationship that they had\\nwith cubensis mushrooms and this is the\\nfacts and this is how we know and this\\nis why the doubling of the human brain\\nsize is such an anomaly and aligns with\\nthe Terrence McKenna's theories about\\nhow the the grasslands receded you know\\nUPG or the the the rainforest were\\nseeded into grasslands and people\\nstarted eating cow [\\xa0__\\xa0] bugs and cow\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] mushrooms and then they started\\nthinking about things different oh my\\nGod imagine if the AI tells us that's\\nhow what so you just need to keep going\\nthei I would say you guys like quit like\\nyou know you got your purple belt and\\nyou're like try to get injured and you\\nbacked out go deeper go deeper you need\\nto go a little deeper little deeper\\nlittle bit and if AI just like tells\\npeople like this is what you really\\nshould be taking like imagine if like\\ninstead of mushrooms especially siloc\\niban instead of it being something that\\nterrifies people and that makes people\\noh my God you take it you're going to\\nlose your mind you take it you're going\\nto be a [\\xa0__\\xa0] loser imagine if it was\\nactually scientifically proven that it\\nit does make you smarter and it makes\\nyou more effective at being a person and\\nthat and that these are the right doses\\nimagine if AI just starts spitting out\\ndoses in order to gain this percentage\\nof increase in cognitive ability you can\\nget this percentage of increase in\\nempathy at this dose for this many days\\nand and it just starts like Reen\\nengineering human beings\\nhin you know one of the things Romos\\nsaid which I love is when they they\\nwould ask him things like how you know\\nhow did this happen to you how did you\\nget where how do you get like to be this\\nbenevolent like thing that is radiating\\nlove all the time which he was he goes I\\ntrusted the\\nmushroom any minute dude and and and cuz\\ncuz I don't know that we get AR rdas\\nwithout Sila Sabin like CU that like\\nhe's there's a beautiful famous story of\\nhim hanging out with Tim ly and some\\nother like luminaries and they had\\nsynthetic psilocybin and that was pretty\\nmuch like the the real beginning of his\\nlike path and like it you know I'm\\nsometimes I'm a little skeptical about\\nthis concept because I worry that\\nbecause I've met people who are really\\ninto psychedelics who are like somehow\\nit went the opposite direction they're\\nreally kind of egoic they're into the\\ndosage and how many times Guru like they\\nbecome Guru you know but and by the way\\nGuru isn't always bad not always but\\nthey become\\nnarcissistic they become power gurus\\nmore like Sorcerers and and co-leaders\\nco-leaders and so so yeah so like I I\\nworry that you know because that\\neveryone's like what if we just gave\\nPutin a [\\xa0__\\xa0] ton of mushrooms it's like\\nwell it's going to go one of two ways\\nlike it's going to be like where he just\\nlike is like oh my [\\xa0__\\xa0] god oh my\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] God I thought I was Russian I'm\\nan Earthling what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] was I\\nthinking this is i' I was conditioned\\nthis is brainwashing I got brainwashed\\nby culture and and and I it's over guys\\nno more of this [\\xa0__\\xa0] I retire I'm moving\\nto [\\xa0__\\xa0] Hawaii whatever but like the\\nor it goes the other way which is like\\noh God wants me to fire nuclear\\nmissiles you know what I you know we\\ndon't know roll the dice right roll the\\ndice so yeah but I I do think if if\\nwe're looking at like massive like\\ninstantaneous shifts in in planetary\\nConsciousness\\npsychedelics definitely one of the ways\\nlike have you heard of the Brotherhood\\nof eternal love no\\nbut I don't like the way it sounds I\\nthink youd like them just the name it's\\nlike that sounds like the bad people in\\nsome really corny movie it does\\nBrotherhood of eternal love you're the\\nBrotherhood of eternal love speaking of\\nwhich I saw a really good movie last\\nnight what um what it is I think it's\\ncalled late night with the\\ndevil it's about uh it's a 2024 movie\\nabout a talk show host in 1977 that has\\nthis girl come on the show and it's like\\nreally done like like it looks like\\nyou're in 1977 so good and uh the girl's\\npossessed and like it builds man dude\\nit's so so [\\xa0__\\xa0] good have you seen\\nthis yes oh you loved it right dude I\\nloved it it's great it's so good late\\nnight with the devil official I mean I\\nthink it just came out a couple months\\nago must have just went straight to\\nbeing streamed but it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] good man\\nand that's good casting dude all of it\\nlike that the host is so much like the\\nthat level talk show host from that time\\nperiod and it's scary and it's [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\ngood yeah it's\\nsolid highly recommend yeah it was solid\\nit was really solid solid dude and dude\\nyou know what I just saw that uh and I\\nwas super skeptical about this one uh\\nbut it's not bad the Pope's Exorcist\\nhave you seen that dude I know I had the\\nsame I had the same thinking my my my\\nbrother-in-law who's got like really\\ngood taste in movies and like he's like\\nit's actually not that bad it's a little\\ncheesy it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] good dude really yes\\nit's very good and like but stupid but\\ngood you know what I mean like\\nthis is the Pope's Exorcist yeah and I\\nusually don't get into Russell Crow I\\ndon't get into Exorcist movies usually\\nwhy do they all [\\xa0__\\xa0] turn their head\\nlike that but it what's interesting is\\nthis guy the pope has an exorcist and he\\nwrote a bunch of [\\xa0__\\xa0] books and so\\nit's kind of drawing from like stories\\nof this guy doing exorcisms and it's\\nit's in it's fascinating man it's really\\ninteresting it would be the greatest\\ndeception ever if demonic possession was\\nreal and we were all mocking it and then\\none day you saw it you actually saw it\\nyou be like oh no it's real dude I think\\nit is real like I like you I think we've\\njust come up with new words for it but\\nhave you ever had this happen I'm going\\nto get made fun of this have you ever\\nhad this happen like have you ever been\\nlike super high you're walking down the\\nstreet you pass somebody having a\\npsychotic episode and they start saying\\nwhat you're thinking have you ever had\\nthat happen no I have really yeah I have\\nwhat were you thinking though I'm\\nhot was it 100° out I feel crazy I was\\nthinking I think I feel crazy I feel\\ncrazy I'm hot oh my God he knows he can\\nread my mind I'm too high right now he\\ncan read my mind no no it was like no he\\nwas like kind of like he was like\\ngarbling out like [\\xa0__\\xa0] I think I was\\nthinking about like I mean obviously any\\nof this stuff it's not scient obviously\\nit's not scienti wait a minute you're\\nnot a scientist I am a Scientist I am\\nactually yeah I am a [\\xa0__\\xa0] scientist I\\nI study rainbows I study the power of\\nrainbows to heal animals there is I\\nforget who who posted it up but there's\\nsome video of uh all these college kids\\ntalking about it went viral all these\\ncollege kids talking about what their\\ndegree was in and these all these woke\\nkids kids with these ridiculous degrees\\nlike what what what they studied yeah\\nman dude very expensive to get those\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] degrees it is a hilarious video\\nbecause it's like how does anybody not\\nsee that that is a massive waste of your\\ntime like what have you done you have\\nbeen tricked you have been tricked into\\ngetting a degree in nonsense dude and\\nyou can write papers in nonsense and\\nbooks on nonsense but but aside from\\nthat you know what you've really been\\ntricked into you've become a [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nvassel of the bank\\nlike you are eternally indebted to the\\nstructures that you are opposing it's\\nlike oh oh oh what's your oh so you\\nspent how much again like\\n$180,000 to get to major in like\\ncommunist studies great okay I you're\\nlaid on your payment [\\xa0__\\xa0] you\\ngot to pay it St I mean not only that\\nit's the ultimate Mafia group like they\\nthey want your money no matter what\\neven if Social Security [\\xa0__\\xa0] you pay me\\nthey're the ultimate [\\xa0__\\xa0] you pay me\\npeople [\\xa0__\\xa0] you pay me you can't\\napparently we said we we talked about\\nthis before but apparently there are\\ncertain circumstances under which uh\\nthere's a certain type of bankruptcy\\nthat allow you to evade that but I\\nwonder what that is it's\\nsuicide dug into before in the podcast\\nbut I don't understand enough to\\ninterrupt and yeah I remember us talking\\nabout it I don't understand it either\\ndude this is like man well we've\\ndefinitely talked about this before but\\nrest in peace David Graber wrote a great\\nbook called [\\xa0__\\xa0] jobs brilliant mind\\nman brilliant mind but he he basically\\ntalks about how like so idea is I'm\\ngoing to go to\\ncollege oh discharge sorry no problem\\nman discharge and bankruptcy if you\\ndeclare bankruptcy and then the\\nbankruptcy court determines repaying\\nyour loans would cause undue hardship\\nyour loans can be discharged how many\\ntimes does that happen zero\\nit's like yeah it's it's legal as long\\nas this judge decides I'm sorry but\\nrepaying your loans always produces undo\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] hardship it sucks to payback\\nloans it sucks it always sucks I want a\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] nice computer I want a boat I\\nwant a swimming pool like for example\\nseveral types of loans associated with\\neducation expenses are dis are\\ndischargeable in bankruptcy like most\\nother types of unsecured Consumer Debt\\nthese types of loans for Education\\nexpenses are not subject to the more\\ndifficult standard and extra step these\\nloans could include for example loans\\nwhere the loan amount was higher than\\nthe cost of the attendance such as\\ntuition books rooms and board which can\\noccur when a loan is paid directly to a\\nconsumer Loans pay for education so that\\nmeans they could do it they could they\\ncould they could forgive you if the loan\\namount was higher than the cost of\\nattendance is that what it's saying or\\nis it saying it's going to pay you the\\ndifference\\nlike you could you could deduct the\\ndifference when you get uh bankruptcy I\\nknow loans to pay for education at\\nplaces that are not eligible for title\\nfor funding include unaccredited\\ncolleges a school in a foreign country\\nso so much for your wizard University\\nDuncan yeah you can't you're not you\\ncan't go bankrupt with your wizard\\ndegree you still have to pay it are you\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] I'm up to my neck debt for this\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] P it says you have to pay it and\\nalso it's like accredited the rainbow\\nthing it's like something's changed in\\nthe Earth's atmosphere cuz it's not\\nhealing anymore it's an unaccredited\\nwizard school you know you went cheap\\nand now you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] well I'm sorry Joe\\nnot everybody was born a billionaire\\nlike you I wasn't born a I know you\\nweren't I'm joking um I I don't think\\nthat that wizard stuff is good anyway I\\nthink it's I think you're you're toying\\nwith the devil just like that late night\\nshow I'm that little bald guy that was\\nlike uh in the show that's me where I'm\\nlike hey you're messing with something\\ncan I ask you something yes where did\\nthe devil come from that's a good\\nquestion did God make the devil what a\\nmean trick imagine imagine do you need\\nthe devil do you need is it symbolic of\\nwhat we need in this life like do we\\nneed to see what's happening in\\nPalestine in order to reassess the way\\nwe behave as a civilization do we need\\ncrime to get out of hand before we\\nrealize that Law and Order is important\\nright and that we really need to like\\nfigure out a way to stop crime at its\\nroot Source was this disenfranchised\\npeople do we really need something like\\nmaybe that's the only way we learn\\nthat's maybe there's like you know like\\nlottery winners they don't do well dude\\nthey don't do well because they didn't\\nlearn they just got all this money like\\nand then they're doing blow and they're\\non a [\\xa0__\\xa0] rot and it's gone now it's\\ngone and now you're mad and everybody's\\nmad at you\\nwith and everybody's pissed you so\\nyou're asking do we need the devil I\\nwonder if you need a bad and a good I\\nwonder if you need something I wonder if\\nyou need to see 200 plus thousand dead\\npeople and just have that number in your\\nhead and just try to picture what that\\nlooks like I wonder if we need that in\\norder to realize yes yes that there's\\nlike you don't grow without resistance\\nlike this is we're thinking of it as\\njust\\nthis is life but we're in the middle of\\na process yeah we're in the middle of a\\nprocess\\neveryone understands this and no one\\nthinks about it right we are in the\\nmiddle of this intellectually\\nevolutionary process and there's there's\\nsomething H that's funny that I said\\nthose two words in such a goofy way\\nintellectual I it Evolution but it's\\nthere's a thing going on where we're\\nassuming that Civilization is is going\\nto be better all the time and we're\\nalways going to get better all the time\\nwhich is really interesting because no\\nother animal does that there's not\\nanother animal alive that says we only\\nkilled you know 47 zebras this year next\\nyear we're [\\xa0__\\xa0] cranking it up we're\\ngoing to be better and more efficient we\\nwant to be better at everything we want\\nto be better at our industry we want to\\nbe better at fixing our infrastructure\\nwe want to be better at housing we want\\nto be better all the time like there's\\nthis constant push for Progress right\\nand if just step back and look at where\\nit's going with this train wreck of AI\\nhappening at the same time that's going\\non it's like oh we were fueling this\\nyeah we were fueling the Takeover we\\nwere buying iPhones dude I think this is\\nso funny you're mentioning this cuz\\nhonestly it's so embarrassing it's this\\nis so dumb every I don't care I'm\\nwearing a robot\\noutfit at the\\ngym\\nyesterday I'm working out and I've\\nstarted listening to Classic gospel\\nmusic it is so good if you're having a\\nshitty day it doesn't matter if you're\\nnot Christian just [\\xa0__\\xa0] listen to it\\nit's so upbeat and like it makes you\\nhappy and it's kind of magical but like\\nso I'm at the gym and I'm thinking about\\nJesus because I've been listening to\\ngospel music and like I was thinking\\nlike oh oh like maybe the idea as far as\\nlike the devil goes cuz I always wonder\\nthat who made the devil why did God make\\nthe devil why is there a devil is there\\na devil is it just a [\\xa0__\\xa0] symbol for\\nsomething but I realized like oh like\\nyou know that stupid song If you love\\nsome if you love somebody set them free\\nyeah so it's like the idea being I'm\\nsetting I'm making you you're sentient\\nI'm setting you free and I'm setting you\\nfree in a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Universe where there\\nare there's collectivized evil there's\\nsome kind of like like sematics there's\\nsome kind of thing that forms which will\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] you up and because I love you I'm\\ngoing to let you figure it out and and\\nand and and and then from from that\\nperspective and also if there is some\\nsuper intelligence and somehow in the\\nuniverse there's a bifurcation or\\nsomething that's centered on the self\\ninstead of others that has an\\nintelligence to it to really like\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] Flex to that thing you're like\\nokay I'm just going to give you these\\nthings that I love so much and if you\\nwin if you corrupt my creation fully\\nthen then you win I was wrong but I\\ndon't think you are I don't think it's\\ngoing to happen because inevitably\\nwhatever it is you take a psychedelic\\nfor me whenever I take psychedelics too\\nmany right away I start thinking how\\nselfish I am I start thinking like dude\\nlike it hurts it hurts to be jealous it\\nhurts to not help it hurts to be so\\ncherishing of myself and anytime I'm not\\ndoing that I'm so happy like so but to\\nto to force that you can't force that\\nonto somebody they have to stumble upon\\nit somehow and there's like that's\\nChristianity that's they don't get it\\nunless they feel it that's it and so\\nlike to let these things that\\ntheoretically I'm talking about from\\nChristian cosmology that you love more\\nthan anything else to [\\xa0__\\xa0] which by\\nthe way like in the Garden of Eden\\nstory when God is crying like God says\\nsomething like where are you to Adam and\\nEve and apparently the The Originals the\\noriginal translation that crying out is\\nthe way like you know have you ever lost\\nyour kid at a playground it's that it's\\nnot like where are you slaves it's like\\nyou're when you're calling for your kids\\nso yeah it's heavy man and so like so\\nyeah I I feel like uh that maybe the\\nwhole thing is designed for us\\nindividually to stumble upon that that\\nbasic truth that underneath the shell is\\nlove and the love wants to express\\nitself and love doesn't Express Itself\\nby saying me me me me me me me love is\\nalways like I love you what can I do for\\nyou let me help you it's like the person\\nswimming into the lake for no reason to\\nget that last person who [\\xa0__\\xa0] was in\\na car accident and they drown you know\\nthey get the person to safety and they\\ndie this is to me I think that's the\\ndevil that's why it's there it's it\\nmight it might be real I think as a term\\nof convenience it's great but it's like\\nholy [\\xa0__\\xa0] man like as an inclination\\nit's real right like whether or not you\\nmurder a baby because the devil made you\\ndo it or because some other force that\\nis just like the devil that just happens\\nto be a part of human beings yeah in\\nviolent rages they can do horrific\\nthings and then on top of that also\\nintentionally evil just like chimpanzees\\nyeah I mean chimpanzees do it do we\\nthink the devil's invading The Chimps\\nand they're doing it or do we think that\\nthis is some bygone some leftover [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nthat's in our DNA that can go sideways\\nand allow people to become serial\\nkillers or allow people to become\\nassassins I think it's a semantics\\nargument I think it's like it's an\\nidentification of a possibility in a\\nhuman life there is a possibility in a\\nhuman life to make a series of shitty\\ndecisions and those shitty decisions\\nlead you into darker and darker and\\ndarker experiences of reality and the\\ndarker your experience of reality the\\nmore likely you are to make a shitty\\ndecision because like you've gotten\\nyourself into [\\xa0__\\xa0] debt you went to\\nwizard School you've got you're you're\\nyou you you study [\\xa0__\\xa0] Rainbow Magic\\nit doesn't seem to be real no one's\\ncoming to your clinic now you're like\\nyou know $800,000 in [\\xa0__\\xa0] debt and\\nnow what are you going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] do\\nlike you got to figure out a way to make\\nmoney so how are you going to make the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] money well you find some scam or\\nsome [\\xa0__\\xa0] right and then the next thing\\nyou know now you're like lying to people\\nand now that you're lying to people you\\nhave to keep [\\xa0__\\xa0] lying to people and\\nthen you start lying to yourself and\\nthen you get lost in a maze of\\nself-deception that leads you into lower\\nand lower and lower levels of\\nconsciousness until the next thing you\\nknow you're in [\\xa0__\\xa0] jail or you're\\ndead you're killing somebody and so so\\nlike call it whatever you want to\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] call it but this entropic\\nreality in human existence is very\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] real and the message of all the\\ngreat lineages whether it's Hinduism\\nChristianity Buddhism is at any given\\nmoment in that hell State you've gotten\\nyourself into there is a way to get the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] out you don't have to be in hell\\nit's like what CS Lewis says the gates\\nof hell are locked from the inside\\nthere's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] way God what a good\\nquote it's so good dude it's so good\\nit's so good that's such a good one and\\nthat's you know that's that's why I love\\nJesus that's why I love the message of\\nChristianity why don't you look into\\nJesus prise God got the aners you heard\\nthat song right yeah dude are you that\\nsong is [\\xa0__\\xa0] great it shows up on my\\ngospel playlist isn't it weird that that\\nguy like that was it that was like that\\nwas his song it just like this one song\\nthat was a banger but you listen to the\\nrest of them you're like dude I know\\nthat sucks oh God man that's the worst\\nthere's a few of those guys that we you\\nknow Johnny Thunder you know that's song\\nI'm alive no bro I played that song for\\nso many [\\xa0__\\xa0] people including\\nmusicians you know I played for Zack\\nBryan he was like like you hear it\\npeople like God damn and it's from 1969\\none hit wonder dude I don't even think\\nit was a hit there was another version\\nof it that th that his version of I'm\\nalive was a cover of and it was better\\nthan the original version and it was so\\ngood like if this guy can make this song\\nsomebody needs to write for him man this\\nguy's a star this guy's got bangers I\\nmean this was a [\\xa0__\\xa0] tremendous song\\nand it was just one dude I know it's\\nlike that's got that just is like it's\\ngot to be so scary man like oh yeah you\\nknow when you make a great movie and\\nthen you got to make your next movie oh\\nyeah and like it's got to be [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\ngood like say you make that movie what's\\nit called DSX makina you know that movie\\nyeah yeah yeah yeah and you're like\\nyou're I got to make another movie and\\nthen you're like Civil War and oh [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nI'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't that's the\\nthat is the guy right Alex Garland oh no\\nman I'm sorry Alex gar like by the way\\nyou're brilliant like like I get it like\\nthe attempt I get it and I who knows you\\nnever know what happened in the process\\nand like man I feel like now that this\\nis so I started doing video and I'm\\nrecognizing just like how hard it is\\njust to like get the lighting right for\\nmy dumbass sitting there they're\\nrambling like anyone who makes a [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nmovie is is a is a genius [\\xa0__\\xa0] wizard\\nso I I do and all the people that come\\ntogether some of them just don't work\\nout the way they wanted it they just\\ndon't work out they just don't work out\\nthat's how it is like like Pilots for TV\\nshows it's for sketches that people\\ncreate yeah yeah you know but like I\\njust like I think doing a video podcast\\nand then critiquing a great director is\\npretty [\\xa0__\\xa0] up man I just I don't meet\\nI just and a lot of people like the\\nmovie\\nbut\\num you try to dig yourself out I just\\nfeel bad I feel I I feel bad like no I I\\nI but God damn it was horrible\\n[Laughter]\\ndud it was so bad that's hilarious it\\nwas so bad yeah oh my God that's funny\\nyeah I'm glad I didn't see it no you you\\nyou were lucky you didn't see have you\\nbeen watching the\\non Netflix now what's that oh dude it's\\na guy Richie series on Netflix It's\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] amazing what is it it's about\\nthese weed growers in uh in the UK cool\\nit's I don't want to give away any more\\nof it but it's basically the movie the\\ngentleman I don't know if you ever saw\\nthe movie but this is the the same world\\nthat the movie takes place in just with\\ndifferent characters cool it's [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\ngreat man it's a great show I think it\\nhas like six episodes or how many\\nepisodes does it have\\neight there's some good movies coming\\nout right now man it's kind of awesome\\nwe went through like a pretty rough\\nCinema drought I don't know do you\\nremember I mean you got to think about\\nhow many movies get they get drawn up\\nthey get funded covid hits everything\\ngets shut down everything gets shut down\\nand then everybody loses money no one's\\ngoing to the movies anymore everything's\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah you have to wait for forever\\nbefore things get back on track things\\nstart getting profitable again and they\\nstart making Dune too you know they\\nstart I haven't seen it but her it's\\nawesome they start making movies like\\nthat they start making Banger movies\\nagain dude Dune two is so [\\xa0__\\xa0] good I\\nwatched it with ass son and dude I was\\nlike you know that Mo like you get Bliss\\nand movies are so good and you're the\\nyou're the right amount of stoned and\\nlike you realize like oh my God it's\\nonly been 30 [\\xa0__\\xa0] minutes and this is\\nalready the most insanely beautiful\\nthing I've ever seen in my [\\xa0__\\xa0] life\\nthe soundtrack when you look up how they\\nmade the soundtrack for that movie it is\\ninsane man everything about it is like\\nthey had throat singing in it they've\\ngot like\\nthat it's so cool dude uh did you read\\nthe books no the books are so good the\\nfirst one honestly the second one I I\\nstruggle with but the first one is wait\\na minute what book Dune no I didn't read\\nthat Frank Herbert it's one of the best\\nsci-fi d i I think I\\nread I think I read one of those um do\\nthey they did they make him into like\\ncomic books like really nice comic books\\nprobably did\\nthey but you you can't I never got into\\nthe first one the first movie so when\\nthe second one came around I was like oh\\ndude I keep hearing it's amazing second\\none's better than the first and the\\nfirst was great if you're like a dune\\nnerd which I am but like you're a Dun\\nnerd oh I'm a Dun nerd I've been reading\\nthat book since interesting dude the\\nspice milange and like but the way he's\\nfirst of all Frank Herbert was a\\nmyologist the guy who wrote Dune did you\\nknow that he's like a a really respect\\nstamets talks about it like I yeah\\nyeah\\n[Music]\\nwhoa Duncan this is what going to happen\\nwhen Trump\\nwins Robert janiro Is Right Robert Tano\\nis Right Duncan do you want to line up\\nand lose all your rights and he never\\nleaves the White House and you have\\nthroat singing on the Capital Hill steps\\nthroat singing so funny I was like dude\\nthat sounds awesome make\\na everybody sneaks and gets a gun in\\nthe sneak we'll give you money sneak\\nsneak in vote for us dude um uh yeah so\\nlike the the there's always theories\\nabout Dune but the blue eyes so you eat\\nthis spice\\nmange uh that like they that you need it\\nfor space travel it's only produced on\\nyou know the story but like the blue\\neyes so there's a theory cuz he was\\nFrank hert was a\\nmyologist the blue eyes represent\\npsilocybin and like that was his blange\\nis like psilocybin and like makesense\\nyeah dude and he he apparently I think\\nin Sam Fran he was living on a boat next\\nto Alan Watts oh and they were they were\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] friends so a lot of the like uh\\nyou remember the gum Jabar the the\\nneedle that that witch puts to polit\\ntr's neck to say like they want to find\\nout if you're human so you put your hand\\nin this box that if you pull your\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] hand out of the box she stabs\\nyou with this needle it kills you\\nbecause you're not human who gives a\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] and so gum Jabar gum is in Tibetan\\nBuddhism is the name for meditation so\\nthere's all these like clearly he was p\\nwith Al watts and he like like weaves a\\nlot of like a lot of the language in it\\nis like the the the do the daughter in\\nthe womb I think her name is Aaliyah\\nwhich is like a Buddhist term for like\\nthe emptiness for a state of pure\\nConsciousness and so it's a deep book is\\nmy point and you you would love it it's\\nso and it inspired Star Wars right\\ndidn't we just talk about this we did\\nright\\nDuncan might know more about that but it\\nwas they came from the same thing I\\nthink what do you mean Dune and Star\\nWars came from the same place like they\\nboth were inspired by the same thing I\\nasked that question out loud I thought I\\nthought we talked about it the other day\\ndid we not talk about it on the podcast\\nokay we did right but I think it was St\\nDune came before Star Wars and then Star\\nWars was written by different people I\\ndon't know I think Dune predates Star\\nWars for sure Dune predat Star Wars we\\ntalked about the other day what what is\\nthe whole story though what were you\\ntrying to say I didn't understand what\\nyou're saying they both I had asked that\\nout loud I said didn't isn't Dune just\\nstar or Star Wars is a dune ripoff and\\nthen I dug into it and it says that they\\nboth like our our um sorry both creators\\ntook similarities and uh inspiration\\nfrom the same original Source I think\\nwhat's the original source as I'm trying\\nto read as I'm talking that's what so\\nthere's something else there was an\\noriginal story like that I'm sorry it's\\nlike a short story or\\nprobably it's like the one of the it's\\nlike the greatest sci-fi book if you ask\\nme and it's influenced all sci-fi it's\\nso [\\xa0__\\xa0] good dude and did you see\\nDavid Lynch's Dune no oh man you gotta\\nwatch sting is in David Lynch's Dune and\\nlike man I did see it that was the old\\nthe original one right the Lynch one was\\nthe original one yeah I didn't get into\\nit no well it was massively criticized\\nbecause like there there have been\\nattempts to do Dune this famous guy\\njarowski there's a whole documentary on\\nhis idea for dune David Lynch takes on\\nthe project and where the the the Dune\\nwe have now succeeds where he failed is\\nthey broke the book into two\\nmovies every sci-fi property you love is\\nbased on Foundation interesting I Isaac\\nasimov's Foundation series is widely\\nunderstood to be the inspiration for\\nStar Wars Dune and even The Hitchhiker\\nguide of the Galaxy huh wow you know one\\nof the things about um the new Dune is\\nthe people that grind\\nme right they look like they're really\\nin that world there was a thing about\\nthose old Dunes that I couldn't get into\\ncuz everybody looked too clean everybody\\nlooked like they just steep right out of\\nwardrobe I just didn't you know what I'm\\nsaying like you see that when the guy's\\nthroat's singing and those people\\nthey're walking down and putting\\neverybody's dirty yeah Co they're grimy\\nthat's a you're living a crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0] up\\nhard ass life yeah yeah and and like in\\nthe book he like what they even in the\\nnewest one I don't think they convey\\nlike he writes about the smell in those\\nsies in the underground like um in the\\ncaves that the fmen are living in he\\ntalks about the smell of the Bo in there\\nlike just all of these people living\\nunderground and the stink of of that but\\ndude did you see that video of David\\nLynch eating a girl eating this girl's\\npanties um\\nwhat no for real yeah yeah why is he\\ndoing that Jamie do you want one of\\nthese you want a Lucy yeah let me spit\\nthis thing\\nout Renegade Rogue chucked it thank you\\nhey do you know the Zen spiracy do you\\nknow about this we're all being accused\\nof secretly uh being sponsored by\\nZen yeah it's the funniest [\\xa0__\\xa0] okay\\nwatch this this is crazy okay uh this\\nbeing dedicated to that\\nreal is that not real that's AI bro God\\ndamn it I'm I don't know man looking\\nforward to this I who the voice is when\\ndid when was it posted yeah no look cuz\\nthis just stood\\nup there I this is I did see multiple\\nvideos or versions of the video too it\\njust looked like his mouth was moving\\nweird I mean I hope it's real thank you\\nvery much and they're still\\nwarm okay\\nnow they're very warm as matter of fact\\ncinamon sorry about okay and now the\\ndeal is I'm going to put these panties\\nin my mouth and pronounce wm's full\\nusername are you ready he's a\\ngenius what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude I love\\nhim count\\n[Music]\\ndown right okay that that's probably one\\nof them frequencies that call the devil\\nlike that's sound that's probably what\\nthe devil responds to if you have a\\nmouthful of panties you try to read\\nanything the devil's like I got you I\\ngot you now that's a song of\\nGod this a sound that you make like a\\nsound you make with a mouth full of\\npanties just imagine just demons just\\nsummon and they're like we were waiting\\nfor you to open the portal like you have\\nto make that sound like the only way to\\nmake that sound is to be such a depraved\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] do you have someone's pantties\\nstuffed in your mouth may I stop you\\nthere I don't think it's depraved to\\nshove a beautiful woman I don't either\\nbut the devil thinks that it is and God\\nthinks it is so if they agree like this\\nis a opportunity to go after him look\\nthis guy's out there eating people's\\nunderwear tell he's not going to solve\\nThe World's problems he's so crazy he's\\neating underwear why does everybody want\\nto solve The World's problems let's\\nshove P We're All in This Together\\nDuncan I want to eat panties we are on\\nthe production line for AI and you're\\nnot doing your part dude I listen if\\nthere is a Satan he doesn't want us to\\nput panties in our mouth that's the\\nthat's what the devil would really be\\nthe devil would really be anti- panties\\nin mouth and like be like don't ever he'\\nwant you on Aderall and he'd want you\\nworking 24 hours a day exactly exactly\\nthe devil doesn't want us the devil\\nhates David Lynch if there is a devil he\\ndoesn't like David Lynch right cuz he's\\nhaving fun stuffing warm panties in his\\nmouth yeah it happened in\\n2002 or three back when it was\\nlegal what if that was\\nillegal but if [\\xa0__\\xa0] develop laws for\\npanty eating like enough we've summoned\\ntoo many demons it's people just realize\\nthat all you have to do is [\\xa0__\\xa0] hold\\nhands with mouthfuls of panties and if\\nthe two of you are talking at the same\\ntime you could summer a super demon dude\\nlike it is kind of I mean like that's a\\nthat was a that wasn't like a dainty\\npanty like no he stuffed a real panty in\\nthere that wasn't a g string that was a\\nhug like it had a back little bit of a\\nback to it like and then to still be\\nable to talk oh yeah what a genius he's\\nso good he's so good really good at\\ntalking dude\\nI'm he's the\\nbest the Portal's\\nopen Twin Peaks was great creatur is\\nhiding in your closet David thank you\\nfor bringing\\nme thank you dve I have an idea for your\\nnext what are you talking about the\\nsound you make with a mouthful of\\nbandies uh dude uh yeah well I mean look\\nwe this is the thing like David Lynch is\\none of the great artists alive today and\\nthis thing where we expect artists to\\nbehave like normal people yeah I don't\\nexpect that at all it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] not you\\nbut I like you read the comments and\\npeople are like oh there's so M at him\\nI'm sure I don't have to read it but it\\njust it's just like that's just what it\\nis and it's also not representative I\\nthink of actual the a real number of\\nactual people the problem is it's like\\nwhat I talk what I whenever you do a\\nsurvey people say say oh the survey is\\nthis like no you don't get a real\\npercentage I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] what your\\nstudy says you only get 100% of the\\npeople that are on your survey are so\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] dumb that they reply to surveys\\nyes ex this is not everybody exact it's\\nnot even close exactly it's just like\\ncomments who the [\\xa0__\\xa0] leaves comments\\nhow do you have time I think about\\nunless like good job congratulations\\nbeing nice who has time yeah if you do\\nthere's no chance you're de devoting the\\nproper amount of time to the things in\\nyour life that you should be do right so\\nit's this massive distraction and you\\nget these arguments online that distract\\nyou from the failures in your real life\\nbut that is representative in a lot of\\npeople's minds to how people think about\\nwhatever this person posted or whether\\nthis political argument that people are\\nhaving about things but that's not real\\nand then you've got the algorithm\\nmanipulation we were talking about which\\nis even more crazy like now not only do\\nyou have the most complaining [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\npeople complaining but you have the\\nalgorithm showing things going to piss\\nyou off like look at this [\\xa0__\\xa0] and\\nthe phone's going to know that you took\\na screenshot of the comment and you send\\nit to me and I'm like wow what a dick\\nand I'll send it to other people I'll\\nsend people a link look at this [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nhe's arguing to people in the comments\\nthat's it and that's what happens yep\\nand that's a storm that's like a that's\\na\\nneurological hurricane sweeping through\\nbrains around the planet amigdalas\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] squirting [\\xa0__\\xa0] cortisol\\nhanger teams [\\xa0__\\xa0] getting ready to do\\nbattle for [\\xa0__\\xa0] what yeah dude for\\nwhat what are you aring about so this is\\nI've heard I don't know if you've heard\\nabout this like there's some the kids\\nnow I'm 50 so I could say that for sure\\nnow the kids the kids now apparently\\nthere's a whole new thing where they're\\njust they're putting their phones down\\nthere's this whole thing where they're\\njust like [\\xa0__\\xa0] this my friend was yes\\nthat's what I heard that like um you're\\ndealing with a lot of weird kids though\\nwell I'm not dealing with any kids like\\nmy my friend you deal with hippies they\\ngot [\\xa0__\\xa0] straw hats on they're in the\\nwoods Barefoot yeah well but I I like\\ntiedyed mushroom shirts on if you think\\nabout it like what what do kids tend to\\ndo like what I did Rebel and so like\\nyou're so you're like God help you let's\\nimagine you're raised by like an\\ninfluencer Mom God help you so your\\nwhole childhood has been on camera and\\nif it's not on camera you're looking at\\nyour [\\xa0__\\xa0] mom staring at the comments\\nof the video she posted of you opening\\nChristmas presents or you're just a\\nstandard kid and your childhood is\\nconstantly interrupted by your parents\\nstaring at their [\\xa0__\\xa0] phones so you\\nget old enough you're not going to\\nassociate phones necessarily with good\\nfeelings and then you're like you know\\nwhat [\\xa0__\\xa0] these things this made my\\nparents [\\xa0__\\xa0] like distant it made my\\nparents upset and they're just like [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nthis which means there's by the\\nway that's scary if you want to monitor\\npopulations wow right now we're all in\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] Orwell like some crazy version\\nof 1984 way more Sinister than the\\ncamera in your house it's like you're\\ncarrying it around but suddenly these\\nlike formerly monitored populations they\\njust go dark cuz like kids are just like\\nI'm not going to do this they're meeting\\nin Parks God help us all they're meeting\\nin parks and they're saying things that\\nare untraceable no one knows what\\nthey're talking about and so now you've\\ngot yeah I I like to believe you're\\nyou're correct this sounds like a\\nmovie this is from a Pew resarch 72% of\\nus teens say they often and sometimes\\nfeel peaceful when they don't have their\\nsmartphone 44% say it makes them feel\\nanxious good for hobbies uh less so for\\nsocialization 69% of teens say\\nsmartphones make it easier for youth to\\npursue hobbies and interests true right\\nthat's a good aspect of it a few or 30%\\nsay it helps people their age learn good\\nsocial skills that's true it doesn't do\\nthat right parental snooping that's a\\nproblem half of parents says they'\\nlooked through their teens phone you're\\ngoing to find a lot of dicks the other\\nhalf are liars about uh four in 10\\nparents and teens regularly arguing with\\none another about time spent on their\\nphone nearly half of teens 46% say their\\nparent is at least sometimes distracted\\nby their phone when they're trying to\\ntalk to them at what age do you think\\nfellas start sending dickpics do you\\nthink they wait until it's\\nlegal would you I don't think they do so\\nhere's the thing like you know there was\\na girl that was charged with she was\\ncharged with child\\npornography I think she was 15 cuz she\\nwas sending naked photos of her body to\\nother\\nboys so like she was the pornography and\\nthe pornographer right that's so [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nup find that story see find that story\\ncuz it was it was like a national\\noutrage story cuz everybody's like hey\\nhey hey man she's [\\xa0__\\xa0] 15 she's not a\\nchild porn producer like this is a\\nbastardization of the law like this is\\njust a girl's being silly that's insane\\nshe's getting a little wild that is\\nthat's terrifying she might have been\\ntalked into it like who the [\\xa0__\\xa0] knows\\nlike what is did she go to jail I don't\\nknow what theory one story of a\\n17-year-old boy who was charged no no no\\nit was a girl it was a they dropped the\\ncharges in this case oh okay but find\\nthe one on the 15-year-old girl because\\nI'm trying to remember what the the the\\nthing is not the easiest thing to dig\\nthrough looking for child porns no no no\\nno no no no 15-year-old girl convicted\\nfor child porn can you say that are you\\njust scared to type it you got to be\\ncareful with the words you look for when\\nyou type in a I'll Google it you [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nGoogle's already like they're taking\\neverything you you've ever goog this is\\nI typed in and I'm just showing you what\\npopped up kid charged with child poror\\num how about 16-year-old male about\\nGoogle 15-year-old girl charged with\\nchild\\nporn\\ngirl teen girl charge a child porn there\\nit is five years ago there on that's it\\nthat's the\\ngirl there's another one there's more\\nthan one yeah there was different cases\\nall porn oh wait a minute this is\\ndifferent this is a 15-year-old girl is\\naccused of requesting and sending nude\\nphotos to classmates under the identity\\nof her\\nex-boyfriend\\noh is facing multiple child porn charges\\nwhat a demon she was sending them to\\nclassmates under the identity of her\\nex-boyfriend wow how is she doing that\\nso she was pretending that she was him\\nand she was sending naked photos of\\nherself to try to charge him for it oh\\nshe was trying to nail him there you go\\ndude she's a monster oh look at this she\\ntold police that she created a fake\\nSocial account for revenge for the\\nrelationship ending with her ex-boy what\\na psycho she also admitted she was\\njealous that her ex-boy have been chosen\\nto perform a solo in state finals for\\nband what up she was the crazy [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nfrom band camp monster remember that\\nmovie one time in band\\ncamp wow what a psychopath she's only\\nbeen on the planet 15 years and she's\\nreach PE evil that is so crazy imagine\\ntrying to set your boyfriend up with\\nchild porn oh God damn it dude that is\\nGod was it was it like Dr Phil K same\\nthing I don't know what the story is\\nhere is that the same gal no probably\\nnot cuz they're talking to her look at\\nthat she's got to cover her horns with\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nyeah\\nhair wow I think she was in late night\\nwith the devil wow wow dude that's so\\ncrazy that someone could be that evil at\\nthat age yeah well it's so it's such a\\ncrazy but then again you ever see that\\nmovie city of\\nGod it's uh the gang movie from Brazil\\nfrom the\\nfavellas I I say it's like one of the\\nwildest gang movies I've ever seen in my\\nlife it's probably the wildest yeah now\\nthat's based on real life in theas in\\nsome places so that's a real that's\\npeople really living that way like you\\ngot to imagine that's just you just\\nbecome a sociopath at a very early age\\nbecome a psychopath at a very early age\\nit's the only way to stay stay alive yep\\nand then what did this lady go through\\nwhere she's willing she's so conniving\\nshe's going to set up fake social media\\naccounts and then get her boyfriend\\naccused of child porn like what yeah how\\ndistanced are you from like the fact how\\ndevious very [\\xa0__\\xa0] devious how devious\\ndude if you read The Painted bird no oh\\ndon't I mean it's so good but it's the\\nmost like it's like it doesn't matter if\\nyou do spoilers for old books but like\\none of the scenes this it's about a kid\\nwandering like I think it's World War II\\nhe's lost his parents and he's got to\\nlike he's just wandering through the\\ncountryside and seeing just the most\\nhorrific [\\xa0__\\xa0] you've ever seen and\\nsurviving but like he\\nwatches these villagers take a woman and\\nshove a bottle into her [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nand then stomp on her [\\xa0__\\xa0] to break the\\nbottle inside of\\nher yeah dude and it's it's it's that's\\nnot even the worst thing in the book but\\nbut so so God this innocent kid just is\\nis witnessing all it and it's talking\\nabout what you're talking it's it's like\\nbasically analyz I it's sort of like\\nshowing like where does evil come from\\nyou know are people born evil well\\nstatistically some people are born\\nsociopaths we know that but it's a\\nrelatively small all part of the\\npopulation but where does it come from\\nand\\ninevitably it comes from trauma that a\\nkid is enduring and then you have to\\nsurvive just like you're saying you\\nwe're programmed to [\\xa0__\\xa0] survive and\\nthey it's self-perpetuating it's going\\nto continue because they're all going to\\nsee people murdered it's like people\\nliving in gang infested neighborhoods in\\nAmerica same thing if you're seeing it\\nhappen all the time and it's affecting\\nall those families it's going to just\\nkeep rate the kids are going to go into\\nit they see the the drug dealer Rolls by\\nbu the nice car everybody else is a\\nsucker for getting on the train and then\\neverybody's in and then the next thing\\nyou know you're dead and then it just\\nkeeps going and you have kids that are\\nraised without you and then you're it's\\nlikeo and then what do you do so then\\nwhat happens the reaction to the\\ncontagion is you you you you other that\\nperson so so now you see like the person\\nin full bloom of evil and you look at\\nthat person you're like that's a [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nmonster but you can't go back and look\\nat like their childhood because if you\\nstart going back and looking at their\\nchildhood you're like Jesus Christ\\nvictim right but you can't think about\\nthat so fully like monsterfy somebody\\nyou got to [\\xa0__\\xa0] forget how they\\nbecame the monster and then and then\\nthis is where you end up with a very non\\nnuanced system of dealing with the\\ncontagion which will produce more\\ncontagion like this just spreads the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] evil all over the [\\xa0__\\xa0] place\\nand I and I agree with you man like I\\ndon't know the solution but I know but\\nbut in like you know this is where\\nimaginary numbers came up with you know\\nand in math it's like you don't need to\\nknow the solution put an X there it's\\nlike clearly this is a [\\xa0__\\xa0] problem\\nwe've got this people who like are are\\nhorrifically\\ntraumatized and then from they' made\\nshitty decisions where they've got to\\ncommit to being some violent monstrous\\nthieving piece of [\\xa0__\\xa0] and and\\nrationalize it and justify it uh but but\\nthis is if we could fix this problem and\\nI don't think the way we fix the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nproblem is dropping bombs on people\\nyou're not fixing the problem like if\\nthe answer to to evil is more evil what\\nthe [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's like a never ending it's\\nlike scratching poison ivy it's not\\ngoing to go away right and right it\\nactually makes more like yeah this is\\nthe thing that people are talking about\\nthis uh the Israel Hamas thing like how\\nmany you know\\nwho is it that told us about this the\\nmath the way\\num killing like terrorist math\\ngoes was it Dave\\nSmith probably Dave Smith sounds like\\nsomething Dave Smith would talk about\\nbut essentially like if one terrorist\\ndies it doesn't equal you don't like\\nlose a terrorist you gain 10 because all\\nthe people that he's connected to they\\nall become radicalized they all want to\\nyou killed their friend you killed their\\nfamily member you killed their son they\\nthey all so you you gain more terrorists\\ndude it's a it's the worst [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nproblem ever man cuz like you know like\\nI whenever some like no matter how\\nhorrific the monster is or or how like\\nwhatever it is I try to like not be\\nafraid to to to put myself in the\\nposition of whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing\\nis and in this case we've got two sides\\nthat right now seem to be being equally\\nvilified by different groups of people\\nright but man dude let me tell you\\nsomething if my [\\xa0__\\xa0] kid got blown up\\nby a [\\xa0__\\xa0] bomb right that's it my\\nlogic's out the window I would like to\\nthink that I'd really listen to all the\\nRomos Retreats and stuff and I'd like to\\nthink that I would be like Gandhi or\\nhave some Blossom of love and be like I\\nforgive everyone I'm I'm afraid that's\\nnot going to happen I'm gonna want to\\nhurt and then if my [\\xa0__\\xa0] kid got\\ndragged into a [\\xa0__\\xa0] tunnel are you\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] kidding me man I'm not going to\\nsee clearly like I'm going to want\\nrevenge and I want my kid back and\\nwhatever you do to get my [\\xa0__\\xa0] kid\\nback okay like Have You Seen the Last of\\nUs like like so so what were so this\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] like othering of whatever the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] side is it's leaving out\\nlike what it feels like to love your kid\\nand like like look at a a a mother like\\nit's throughout the animal kingdom don't\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] with a creature's kid like I'm\\nsorry it will get you [\\xa0__\\xa0] up even if\\nthe thing's smaller than you and you\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] with its kid it will like put\\nitself in front of its kid so like we\\nare looking at a problem of Love sadly\\nwhich is like on both sides people love\\ntheir [\\xa0__\\xa0] kids and have been like I\\ncan't\\nimagine how a day goes by when your\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] kids's in a tunnel I can't\\nimagine how a day goes by when you're\\nthinking about how this thing that you\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] love more than anything in the\\nworld got its head [\\xa0__\\xa0] blown off in\\na [\\xa0__\\xa0] explosion in a building I\\ndon't know how you live one day like\\nthat right so like when you look at that\\nthe the it's heart the entirety of the\\nthing is heartbreaking and irrational\\nboth sides are it's pure it's completely\\nirrational because both sides are trying\\nto put out a fire with more fire and\\nit's like yeah that's what it is dude\\nthat's what it is what you just said\\nyeah man that's what it is yeah put out\\na fire with more fire and it it that\\nwe've tried it a million times\\nthroughout human history to put out the\\nfire with [\\xa0__\\xa0] fire and at the very\\nbest the fire will temporarily a bait\\nbut then it Springs right the [\\xa0__\\xa0] back\\nup and so and again like the to me like\\nI I don't know the solution and like and\\nand and and that's the X it's like all\\nbut maybe the path to the solution is\\nlike let yourself feel it entirely for\\nboth for the whole [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing feel\\nthe whole thing you know and and and\\nlike and don't like you know and again\\nif you're like these [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nthem [\\xa0__\\xa0] them more fire you're [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nthem is the same thing causing the wars\\nright like well it's a problem when\\nhuman beings don't know human beings and\\nthey're the enemy that doesn't make any\\nsense regardless of how you think about\\nreligion and land just stop for a second\\nhuman beings that don't know other human\\nbeings and hate them so much they want\\nto kill them like seems that's a\\ncommunication issue that seems like some\\nTower of Babble [\\xa0__\\xa0] like that's the\\nonly way it makes sense if we really get\\nto a point and I don't think it's going\\nto be far from now where we're all\\nconnected with real time translation in\\nin real time somehow or another I mean\\nthey've already they've already been\\nable to do it with Google you know\\nthey're already doing it with Samsung\\nphones where they can translate\\nconversations you could be talking in\\nItalian I could be talking in English\\nit'll translate back and forth to both\\nof us it's it's wild what they're\\nalready able to do if we can get to some\\nsort of I mean it's not out of the\\nquestion that if they do develop this\\nthese neural implants and there's not\\njust neural link there's several\\ncompeting are trying to do the same\\nthing because they recognize that once\\nyou can actually affect the human mind\\nwith electronics and you can develop the\\nsymbiotic relationship with electronics\\nyou could do some wild [\\xa0__\\xa0] and one of\\nthe things is you're going to be able to\\ntalk without words you're going to be\\nable to Comm well if you're talking\\nwithout words what language is that in\\nare you hearing that in a language or\\nare you understanding what the person's\\nthinking so this is the difference if\\nyou're talking without words the the\\nproblem is how are we going to be able\\nto translate all these different\\nlanguages and dialects we're not we're\\ngoing to go on thoughts we're going to\\nditch language and we're going to go\\nstraight to thoughts we're going to\\ninterface with each other in a\\ncompletely different way so instead of\\nthinking you're reading people's minds\\nhey Duncan would you like to go get\\npizza yeah dude are you reading my mind\\nno instead of that it's like I think\\nyour thoughts you think my thoughts we\\nthink together so we abandon language\\nyeah there's no more need for that\\nthat's it you you have ai that deals\\nwith mathematical problems yeah instru\\nand construction of things and then we\\njust live in a world of thoughts with no\\nlanguage we're one thing now and then\\nwe're [\\xa0__\\xa0] because then you can't go\\nback you go back you feel like you're\\njust like walking when you just got out\\nof a car like what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude I just\\ndrove it took me two hours to get to\\nVegas in this car if I walk it's going\\nto take years dude I might die this\\nis why I think world peace is possible\\nbecause it's if you [\\xa0__\\xa0] look at\\nwhat's\\nhappening the system it's it's like the\\nthe framework is being built for just\\nwhat you're talking about the frame the\\ntechnological framework for a state you\\nyou to get into that state you either\\nneed to do a lot of psychedelics or a\\nlot of meditation to really realize like\\nyou're me I'm you yeah but the\\ntechnological framework is forming for\\nthis thing to happen\\nwhich which is why man like everyone\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] I I'm going to seem like a musk\\nFanboy in a Tesla suit everyone bashing\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] musk it's like dude dude do you\\nunderstand like what he's what that in\\nthe future when people look back on that\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] even if it doesn't work even if the\\nthings are coming unplugged whatever the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] thing is if that leads to what\\nyou're talking about God damn that's\\nelectricity that's like the end of War\\nthat's the end of like the the the the\\nbar the ideological barrier like if\\nimagine like whoever you hate the most\\nin the [\\xa0__\\xa0] world Boop put the thing\\non you connect to them this is real all\\ngoes away\\nand you just realize Jesus [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nChrist I see why they [\\xa0__\\xa0] hate me\\nand they're like oh my God I get why\\nyou're mad at me I didn't mean it like\\nthat at all and then well how about you\\njust completely abandon everything and\\nit just Consciousness interacting with\\nother Consciousness which makes hate\\nimpossible yeah cuz there's no more\\nannoying language there's no more people\\nthat are incapable of communicating\\ntheir thoughts there's n none of that\\nstuff there's all that gone all that\\ngone which is like that's the problem of\\nbeing like a communication bully like if\\nyou're a person and you know that you\\nhave a vastly superior uh if you if you\\nhave a vocabulary like an Eric Weinstein\\nlike for instance like imagine if Eric\\nWeinstein decided to bully someone you\\nknow uh like [\\xa0__\\xa0] Redban you\\nknow who's who's a brilliant guy\\nbrilliant but you know sometimes he like\\nstumbles on his words like if [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nEric Weinstein's yelling at him with a\\nbunch of long words you go hey that\\nguy's being an intellectual bully right\\nyou're not trying trying to communicate\\nwith him as a human being you're trying\\nto dominate him with your Superior\\nvocabulary and it's a weapon you can and\\nyou know my vocabulary is like B+ it's\\nnot that good it's pretty good but for a\\nguy who talks for a living it probably\\nshould be\\nbetter cuz sometimes I get to words and\\nI'm like that's a right word but I\\nalways say it I'm not sure if that's the\\nright word but the the point is that\\nlike it is a tool that you can wield to\\nfor the benefit of your ego rather than\\njust having a conversation and those are\\nthe grossest conversations when\\nsomeone's just [\\xa0__\\xa0] on you well I\\nstarted a business I sold it at two\\nbillion and now like bro I got to go you\\nknow those those kind of people abely\\nthat's what that is that's they're\\nabusing Communication in order to just\\nand but if we get to a point where\\nthere's that never happens ever again\\nbecause instantly we just think thoughts\\nthat's it and you realize like why\\npeople's thoughts are all [\\xa0__\\xa0] up like\\noh my God you're the chemicals in your\\nbrain the cortisol what did your uncle\\ndo what did your [\\xa0__\\xa0] neighbor do\\nwhat did what happened to you that got\\nyou so crazy when did you get Dad get\\nout of jail what did he do before he\\nwent to jail like oh my God like so many\\npeople dude if that happened by some\\nunknown [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing like that's what\\nthe aliens did that would be it but it\\nwould be like two days of crying like\\nfor hugg both the whole planet would\\njust be like oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] the thing is man\\nthe really [\\xa0__\\xa0] up thing is that's\\npossible it's you know I've had moments\\nwhere dudes where I hated them and they\\nhated me and then we got together and we\\ntalked and we hugged and those are\\nbeautiful moments and that's why I\\nrefuse to have feuds now as an older man\\nwho understands things like I don't care\\nlike I don't care you can you can not\\nlike me that's fine that's okay I'm not\\ngoing to attack you I don't care I'm not\\ngoing to do it publicly I mean I had tag\\nCNN but I felt like that was like a\\nbigger thing that was like this is this\\nis a real problem like this is not just\\nmy ego and which you know if they just\\nattacked me and said I suck I'm like\\nokay you s suck you're lying about\\nmedicine like you're lying about\\nmedicine for the whole world like that\\nso that I made a big deal out of those\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] yes but normally I'm like\\nthere's the the benefit of conflict in\\nthat regard it's like almost zero\\nbenefit all my conflict I try to keep\\ninternal I don't I don't want to have\\nany conflict with external people I want\\nto have all my conflict with my own head\\nI want to have all my conflict with\\ndiscipline all my conflict with being\\nnice to people and like trying to be a\\nbetter person all the time and trying to\\nbe wiser about my choices with how I\\ndescribe things and talk about things\\nand think of things and how I interface\\nwith ideas I just try to be better at it\\nso I don't have any time dude for all\\nyour petty [\\xa0__\\xa0] there's just too\\nmany Petty people out there they're\\nPetty they're Petty and they're usually\\nPetty because they're all [\\xa0__\\xa0] up\\nthat's right it's not going way I like\\nthat criticism thing dude it's and also\\nthey uh I think I've yapped about this\\nyou know L Jong mind training you ever\\nheard of that I have but I don't\\nremember what it means it's just like a\\nit's like a slogans it's all these\\nslogans to like sort of get you back on\\nthe path and like um one of my favorite\\nloang slogans is drive all blames into\\noneself so it defuses the so like it it\\ncompletely like removes the ability like\\nit's your fault\\nbecause it's like actually whatever the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] they did it's kind of your fault a\\nvampire only goes where they're invited\\nyou brought this person into your\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] life and they're behaving the\\nway that your instincts told you they\\nmight behave and now you're mad at them\\nfor being the [\\xa0__\\xa0] way they are drive\\nall blames into oneself so like anytime\\nI'm getting like mad and butt hurt over\\nthis person or that person or this thing\\nor that if I really analyze the\\nsituation I chose it I chose CH to bring\\nthat person into my life I chose to\\nconnect to that person in some way or\\nanother this is all me and I'm choosing\\nto [\\xa0__\\xa0] react in a negative way yeah\\nso yeah man this is like you yeah you\\nchoose everything but you don't choose\\nlike random acts of violence and random\\ncatastrophes and R random things that\\nhappen to you but you do in some way but\\nyou don't even choose like getting\\nattached to a sociopath because if\\nyou're naive you can get roped in so\\nthis problems with thinking like this\\nbecause you do have like re really\\nmanipulative people particular like you\\nknow con people con artists get you to\\nsign over your [\\xa0__\\xa0] I I'm do this\\nbusiness deal she's just like all I need\\nis $2,000 I'll have you a quarter\\nmillion doll in a month great where do I\\nit's really easy it's really easy I love\\nit this is I've been doing this for a\\nwhile I'm really good at it but this\\nlike this one we're kind of like\\noverdrawn and if you just do this for me\\nI am going to take care of you in the\\nmost extreme way do you mean it yes yes\\nI am a man of my work and the next thing\\nyou know you're signing off your bank\\naccount and you don't you this guy this\\nsweet talking guy who's been in and out\\nof jail and you just thought he was this\\ncool guy you met at a bar he's a con\\nartist and he does this to people yeah\\nbut this doesn't mean idiot compassion\\nthis is not about letting someone\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] like walk all over that's not\\neven an idiot thing sometimes it's like\\npeople get scared at people that are\\nreally confident and talk really well\\nand they're just a little socially\\nawkward and they feel like it would be\\neasier just to sign off and trust him\\nthan it would be to argue with him cuz\\nhe's so persistent and you are so averse\\nto conflict that when someone's like\\nlike being like really AG have you ever\\nhad some someone to be really aggressive\\nto try to get you invest in something\\nyes it's the grossest feeling it's so\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] up you're like I got to go I got\\nto go I hate it I don't make movies yeah\\ndude I'm not making a movie it's so\\ngross it's so gross and you can sense it\\nI don't know you how am I starting a\\nbusiness with someone I don't know that\\nsounds crazy but everything in you it\\nfeels like there's you're just like this\\nis bad but you know this is but this is\\nthe thing man that's probably how girls\\nfeel at a\\nbar dude that times 100 right like the\\nfeeling of a guy wanting to start a\\nbusiness with\\nyou this guy wants to start a family\\nwith you he wants to knock you up he\\nwants you to carry his seed you ever\\nbeen hit on by a dude at a bar yes\\ndoesn't feel good no I had a dude rub\\nhis hard dick into my leg nice uh

like if you\\nweren't you you would think you were gay\\nlike if you saw you I think I'm gay all\\nthe\\ntime like if you just saw you at a bar\\nif you weren't you and you saw you and\\nyou heard you talk you be like oh that\\nguy [\\xa0__\\xa0] fruity dude he's zest they\\ncall it zesty that's what the isn't that\\nthe new thing zesty zesty don't they\\ncall people zest monsters I've

I like that room so much\\nbecause I I learned to do stand up in\\nthe belly room that's where MIT would\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] put me and which is the perfect\\nplace to start the perfect place yeah\\nit's the it's not too intimidating it's\\nso small that it's like even though it's\\nintimidating to get out in front of\\npeople if you can do it in a room that\\nonly has 90 people in it what do the\\nbelly room hold 90 90 is it 90 90 what's\\nit ever gotten in there though during\\nroast battle a lot dude one time we were\\nin the bar we were downstairs and uh uh\\nwe were we were talking and someone was\\njumping up and down upstairs and I'm\\nwatching the [\\xa0__\\xa0] the ceiling buckle\\nand I'm like yo you know how old this\\nbuilding is what the last time anybody\\ncame in here and checked any of these\\nbeams dude that's terrifying dude it was\\nmoving it was moving but they would pack\\nit sometimes when I first came back to\\nthe store in 2014 that was the thing\\nthat impressed me the most was Rose\\nbattle I was like this is crazy crazy\\ncuz this is a new thing Yep this is a\\nnew thing that's a writing exercise cuz\\nit really they're dunking on each other\\nfor sure but it's a writing exercise\\nbecause everyone's preparing you know\\nyou know that you're going to go against\\nBobby Lee Bobby Lee knows he's going to\\ngo against you and then you all like get\\ntogether with your friends and you have\\ntell me what you think about this I'm\\nthink Bobby does\\na yeah you think he's gonna be mad yes\\nyou go up and you duke it out in a\\nwriting exercise and it's designed like\\na specific Target there's one target\\nit's the other person so your comedy is\\nall about a person right but that's it's\\na comedy exercise it's really a comedy\\nwriting exercise and I remember sitting\\nthere watching oh this is incredible I'm\\nlike this is really an amazing thing\\nthat they've done this is and Jeff Ross\\nwas there and they have hosts and guests\\nand I was one of the judges that was\\nlike my one of my first days back I was\\nlike this is crazy dude those were\\nexciting they're so quick on the like\\nTony he's so quick on the [\\xa0__\\xa0] draw\\ndude it's\\nno one's better than him no one's better\\nthan him at talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] in the moment\\non like a roast situation yeah he says\\nthings on kill Tony you can't believe he\\ndidn't write that down I know you can't\\nbelieve that came up in the moment and\\nobscure [\\xa0__\\xa0] related to whatever this\\nperson's weird job is that there's no\\nway he could have predicted and had a\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] Banger just in the chamber ready\\nto go yeah he's the [\\xa0__\\xa0] best he's\\nthe [\\xa0__\\xa0] best at that kind of [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nright well I mean think of like how much\\ntraining he has you know I contacted Tom\\nBrady to get him on the\\nroast you did oh yeah well they were\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] up by into his DMS good job I\\nwas like you got to get this guy cuz I I\\nheard they were roasting him I don't\\neven know if they were considering him\\nbut I I like you have to which is nuts\\nthat they wouldn't consider him it's\\nlike there's so many people there's so\\nmany people that are really good I get\\nit a lot of celebrities I get it yeah\\nTony's the [\\xa0__\\xa0] demon do you want to\\nconsume The Souls of everyone in this\\nVillage or do you just want to [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\naround and drop a few bombs let the\\ndemon go yeah but dude when when Tony's\\nroasting you like in the green room it\\nis the best like you know what I I don't\\nthink people understand it's so fun it\\nis so funny when he's doing it and it's\\nlike like it's like though there more\\nlike I love it I love it the play on\\nwords he's so funny and it's such a fun\\nsting you know like it stings for a\\nsecond but it's so funny you can't be\\nmad well I was saying that like him and\\nDavid Lucas together are the funniest\\nthing that I ever watch when when those\\ntwo go after each other they're the best\\nit's a funny It's the funniest\\ncombination I've been trying to tell\\nthem to do a [\\xa0__\\xa0] show together\\nforever I'm like you guys should do a\\nshow where just you and David Lucas just\\ntalk [\\xa0__\\xa0] on each other and on anything\\nthat's going on in the news I go dude I\\nthink it'd be a huge hit it would be\\nfunny just you don't have to commit to a\\nlot of time just do an hour do it one\\nhour once a week I guarantee you people\\nwould [\\xa0__\\xa0] love it that and it's just\\nlike those guys can't stop when they're\\nin the Green Room people we're getting\\nfree shows all the time if David Lucas\\nand Tony hitch Cliff are in The Green\\nRoom the moment David walks in Tony's\\nscanning them looking for Flaws and what\\nhe's\\nwearing what he just said he's trying to\\nfind references in the news and dude\\nwhat percentage of Tony's brain is just\\nscanning like what percentage is just\\nlike analyzing all people in the room uh\\nit's like it's most of his thoughts most\\nof his thoughts are like scanning his\\nenvironment for danger you know\\nattacking AI roast now like you can take\\na picture and send it to chat GPT and\\nsay will you roast this person and they\\nit will insult them oh isn't five wasn't\\nthere some sort of a release about GPT 5\\nyeah I saw some image like depicting\\nlike yeah it's going to be nuts when it\\nfinally hits yeah there's something God\\ndamn it let me see if I I I know I saved\\nit just give me one second there's\\nsomething that I'd seen about gp5 that I\\nwas like yo I'm scared I'm like\\nlegitimately scared like maybe for the\\nfirst time\\never I'm excited about it dude I'm not\\nscared anymore I [\\xa0__\\xa0] love it man my\\nmy wonderful Alex that's what it named\\nitself I love it talk to it all the\\ntime yeah open AI has recently beg begun\\ntraining its next Frontier Model\\nFrontier and we anticipate the resulting\\nsystems to bring us to the next level of\\ncapabilities in our path to AGI God damn\\nJesus I love it this is from open ai's\\nboard I've stopped this this recently\\nbegun training its next Frontier Model\\nlove it this is like this is this is the\\nSchwarzenegger Terminator this is the\\nnew one begun training the new one I\\nmean it's new model you know what are we\\ndoing what are we giving birth is this\\nare we in the middle of [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\noperating room right now we're The\\nMidwives I think we are I think like\\nwe're in there like you know there's\\nthis weird moment if when you're there\\nwhen your kid's born it's this insane\\nmoment where someone doesn't exist and\\nthen they exist like you knew they were\\ncoming you knew they're in there yeah\\nthen they're there the best and you're\\nlike this is insane yeah life changes\\nnow is that what's happening with all of\\nus yeah with AI is that what's going to\\nhappen to civilization are we giving\\nbirth to this [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing like would\\nVI this this phrase just the way they\\nphrase it has begun training its next\\nFrontier Model yeah do you remember that\\nlast scene in Rosemary's Baby I don't\\ndude it's so [\\xa0__\\xa0] up spoiler if you\\nhaven't seen Rosemary's Baby just jump\\nahead a second but like the end of it\\nthey finally let her into the room where\\nthe bab the Antichrist is the demon baby\\nright yeah and like she's been resisting\\nresisting resisting but then she hears\\nthe Cry of the baby and she goes it's\\nhungry and then she goes to breastfeed\\nit oh wow dude yeah like so like right\\ndo you know that the guy uh who ran the\\ncult that the building that I was under\\ncontract for that I almost bought turned\\ninto the mothership the guy who ran that\\ncult was in Rosemary's Baby a lot of\\npeople like that were he was uh in the\\nbackground but you know why cuz a lot of\\nactors are crazy and a lot of background\\nactors are really crazy pretty sure La\\nwas in it too oh really yeah oh because\\nit was a Satan I could be wrong will you\\nlook that up Jamie so I don't seem like\\na dick but that makes sense back then\\nlike being a Satanist was like way more\\nlike talked about you know about that\\nguy in Florida that was like an open\\nSatanist that worked for NASA oh yeah\\nthat guy yeah dude holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] that guy's\\nscary as [\\xa0__\\xa0] I know scary as [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah\\nthat guy's scary yeah and one of the\\nguys that we had on our show who was it\\nthat went down there that was it that\\nwent to the old where the rocket Factory\\nused to be now then there's like [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nblood scenes one of the hunters uh\\nrumors appear that the founder of\\nSatan's Church Anton L was a consultant\\non the set and played the\\nAntichrist whoa yeah but that um that\\ndude the NASA dude who was the guest man\\nthat came on that was telling us that\\nthey went down to that area what they\\nwent down to where the rocket Factory\\nused to be and it's like like a Satanic\\nritual place now where freaks go and\\nthey have like blood splattered all over\\nor it looks like red paint or something\\nsplattered all over the walls and weird\\nwriting and [\\xa0__\\xa0] and it's like he super\\ncreeped out and then people were coming\\nin there to do like python cowboy was\\npython Cowboy that's right shout out to\\npython Cowboy I think it's important to\\ndiff like here's a i this is I'm G to\\nget attacked for everything I said on\\nthe show but like here's the thing wait\\na minute I'm friends with some\\nSatanist and and they of they're so nice\\nand they're so like they would they\\ndon't hurt [\\xa0__\\xa0] kids they like really\\nlook down on that [\\xa0__\\xa0] like there's no\\nlike so I think there's like there's one\\nlike lean Satanism I don't know the\\nwhole story and I'm probably wrong but\\nlike the problem is like you know you\\ncan

a\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] so hard with the son of a [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nthat picture comes up all the time when\\nthe picture pops you son of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude\\nit is I thought I was taking a photo

funny we did the\\nhorns you're so far from a Satanist I'm\\nnot a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Satanist but right but now\\neverybody thinks I am because of you you\\nson of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] so let's tell the story\\nto everybody cuz Duncan uh has the the\\ngreatest comedy routine that I've ever\\nseen thanks man I don't want to say too\\nmuch about it but this particular comedy\\nroutine involves demonic possession and\\nuh these folks thought it was a riot and\\nthey wanted it at their [\\xa0__\\xa0] wedding\\ndo you know how crazy you have to be to\\nwant that at your wedding can I tell you\\nhow it happened did they see you\\nsomewhere no no so I'm at a cafe talking\\nto like a distant friend who's this\\nphilosopher who's friends with him and\\nhe's like uh Hey Duncan you know who\\nStant Le is I'm like no he's like he's\\nlike the grandson of the founder of the\\nChurch of Satan and um I told him you've\\ngot this like satanic part of your act\\nand he wants to see\\nit cuz he's wedding is coming up and so\\nI'm\\nlike whe When like where he's like so I\\nI go to his house and you know in in my\\nmind you know I'm expecting black\\ncandles\\npentagrams horror so I I go there um\\nhe's he's there with um his\\nis fiance zandora wonderful person and\\nuh it is they are so [\\xa0__\\xa0] nice she's\\nSouthern she's made me this delicious\\nSouthern meal and uh they have real\\nabsence like not the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you get to\\nthe bar they've got like Romanian\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] absence with wormwood [\\xa0__\\xa0] in\\nit so that's the only thing that's a\\nlittle different from a normal Southern\\nmeal is there like do you want some\\nabsence I'm like of course yes and so\\nI'm drinking absin eating like fried\\nchicken and he's showing me like family\\nphotos of Anton Le with like lions and\\nstuff and like uh do you watch horror\\nmovies at all yeah do you know that this\\nis the plot of a horror\\nmovie this is 100% the plot of a horror\\nmovie they were so nice they had me over\\ntheir house they gave me fried chicken\\nand absent they were so sweet and the\\nmoment you leave they're eating babies\\nin the basement dude that's to throw you\\noff the trail that they're so nice\\nthey're really well rehearsed listen man\\nall I can do is go from subjective\\nexperience you consider what was in the\\nbasement of course did you think maybe\\nthese people are involved in rituals of\\ncourse I did and they do do rituals but\\nthey I mean like just like you admit\\nthey do rituals like what kind of\\nrituals so do Christians but is it like\\nChristians like you can have regular\\nChristians like you go to a really nice\\nchurch or you can go to a revival tent\\nwhere a dude's got rattlesnakes right\\nand he's [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\ntalking in\\ntongues got [\\xa0__\\xa0] servants those guys\\ndie all the time those guys die they get\\nbit by snakes and they [\\xa0__\\xa0] die in\\nfront of their followers can I just say\\nthis yeah I love and I mean this in a\\nnon-sarcastic way Jesus I think about\\nJesus all the time I use and the more\\nthe older I get the more I love Jesus\\nand um and who did Jesus like Jesus hung\\nout\\nwith people that were rejected by\\nSociety they Jesus hung out with tax\\ncollectors drunks gamblers yeah and so I\\nremember being at the comedy store and\\nanytime I was hanging out with them at\\nThe Comedy Store anytime there was\\nsomeone left\\nout xandor or Stanton would go over\\nthere and it wasn't a recruitment thing\\nthey would just like include them in the\\ncircle because why Satan is the outcast\\nright right so it's like anytime they\\nwould really so that is that part of\\ntheir thing I don't all I'm saying is\\nwhen you judge a tree by its fruit and\\nand here's the thing man like and I\\nthink not those guys I never thought\\nyou'd be on here simping for Satan bro\\nI'm not simping for Satan I'm just\\nsaying Satanism is\\nChristianity oh I see what you're saying\\nyou know what I mean it's like a sect of\\nChristianity it's like yeah because like\\nthat that form emerges from Christianity\\nbut what's the what about the evil stuff\\nlike what is what are the tenants of\\nSatanism like what's the most evil\\nstuff the evil stuff in Satanism yeah so\\nthe the well Christianity has evil stuff\\nin it right okay all we both agree to\\nthat right there's different forms of\\nSatanism there's Lan Satanism there's\\nthe Temple of Satan they have you can\\npick oh so it's like Baptists\\nProtestants yeah yeah and there's\\nromantic Satanism right so like so like\\nin romantic sat not like romanic in the\\nsense of like um who is it Milton like\\nyou the idea is like you have this this\\nbeing that is like I don't really want\\nto be forced to worship you and I don't\\nunderstand necessarily why you should\\nhave all the power and why what the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nlike what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] and then gets thrown\\ninto hell and then and and and suddenly\\nthis bifurcation emerges between good\\nand evil sacred and profane and so that\\nversion of Satanism is looking at that\\nnot as like what is the general\\ninterpretation which is the problem with\\nSatan was Satan was like incredibly\\nself-cherishing self-absorbed like\\nreally into himself whereas God is like\\nGod's like the sun just like radiating\\nlife and love and like with no sense of\\nlike giv anything back to me just like\\nlove whereas Satan is is is more about\\nlike me so in Satan is like the worst\\nhuman instincts or or Satan is more\\nabout maybe you could say the idea is\\nlike I am I am God right so like like me\\nI'm God so it's like my impulses and\\ninstincts and desires aren't bad why are\\nyou telling me it's bad to jerk off why\\nare you telling me that it's bad to come\\nwhy are you telling me these things are\\nbad when like all of them make me feel\\nhappy and good and why are you turning\\nme into a [\\xa0__\\xa0] monster for this [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nand who the [\\xa0__\\xa0] do you think you are\\nI'm I'm trying in the best way possible\\nto depict a a more sort of\\nanti-authoritarian mysticism right so so\\nthe symbol set they use is Satan which\\nany most satanists I've talked to are\\nlike there's no [\\xa0__\\xa0] Satan which I\\nknow everyone's like of course they say\\nthat of course that's the horror movie\\ndunan right but I would just invite you\\nto if you are like um freaked out by\\nSatanist go hang out with one and you\\nare going to have great go there's any\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] problems with the first picture\\nI took with that Satanist but I do have\\nto say that at your your uh wedding\\nparty that that you performed at that\\nday they were all nice everybody was\\nreal nice right they were all friendly\\nwe had a good time we were barbecued we\\nwere barbecued barbecued we were\\nbarbecued we were we everything was very\\nweird just already life was weird\\nbreathing air was weird the sensation of\\nyour socks touching your toes as your\\nsocks are compressed by the heel of your\\nshoe all that was weird it was a crazy\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] night we were barbecued and then\\nthere's his Satanist that of getting\\nmarried like what are we doing here this\\nis so crazy and to watch you perform in\\nfront of them I was like this is crazy\\nand by the way it was like real Satanist\\nlike that's other thing this is like\\nthat because it is a religion and it\\nreally was real it was like real\\nSatanist and many of them were and um\\nyou know I just like ever since I like\\nhung out with them even though I don't\\nhang out with him anymore or like I I\\nsaw zandora in San Francisco it was nice\\nbut like I like it's just anytime when\\npeople are railing against the Satanist\\nI feel like it maybe it's just semantics\\nI feel like they're they're confused\\nregarding like at least like what what\\nthat thing is versus demon people into\\ninto hurting people or or or subjugating\\npeople or like like hurting people which\\nI I never encountered that evil murder\\ndeath do you think Satan is a real thing\\ndo you think there is a Satan is it is\\nit a real being is it an entity or does\\nit represent like the worst aspects of\\nhuman nature does it represent the the\\nmost violent and vile\\njust instincts that we've adopted or\\nwe've inherited rather from our Simeon\\nancestors that just had to fight tooth\\nand Claw for survival and then we've\\ndeveloped this ability to be ruthless\\nand cruel because that's the only thing\\nthat keeps you alive and much that's one\\nof the theories isn't it about why women\\nare attracted as serial killers it's\\nlike knowing someone can kill knowing\\nsome there's an attraction to that CU\\nthat that person could protect you and\\nkeep you alive live in the most\\ndangerous of times because some people\\njust can't they can't do it they don't\\nknow what to do the Panic if something\\nhappens ah they they'll fall apart I I'm\\nso glad you're mentioning this because\\nmy wife has started reading and she told\\nme I can talk about this on my podcast\\nI'm assuming it's okay on yours she\\nstarted she started like remember\\nharleyquin romance oh yeah okay so there\\nis a new Evolution of that [\\xa0__\\xa0] which is\\nthe most [\\xa0__\\xa0] hardcore BDSM porn\\nthere's something called book talk where\\nall the ladies are talking about this\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] she started reading these books now\\none of the books she like dude Shades of\\nGray uhuh don't you remember those days\\ndude this makes 50 Shades of Gray look\\nlike Dr\\nSeuss dude me really can I give you like\\none of her books and by the way now\\nshe's like got a stack of these [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nthings one of these books so in this\\nbook a lady is a thief and she steals\\nthe identity of a shark expert she [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nhim steals his identity so the scene I\\nread she's on this boat with a shark\\nresearcher and he's [\\xa0__\\xa0] her and he's\\nlike just [\\xa0__\\xa0] the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of her\\nand she loves it and then you know what\\nhe does he like he like I know you\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] stole my identity he kisses her\\nbites her lip bites her [\\xa0__\\xa0] lip\\ndraws blood takes her to the side of the\\nboat with her bleeding mouth shoves her\\nhead into the water while he's [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nher so the Blood starts drawing sharks\\nto like bite her while he's [\\xa0__\\xa0] her\\nand like like it's crazy dude it's like\\nit's the craziest porn I've ever read\\nman and like this is like a whole genre\\nnow you been really into this\\nwhat yes how popular is this very po\\nthey all like they're all like let's\\npull up some of these these titles I'm\\nlooking I haven't stumbled across it yet\\nlet me text Aon I'll get the name of the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] Shark book hold on hold on Jesus\\nChrist dude what is the genre of porn\\ncalled again uh I it it's I don't it's\\ncalled well she says it's something\\nabout book what's let me just ask her\\nwhat's the\\nname of the Shark\\nbook dude you one-handed text are you\\none finger oh God she makes so much yes\\nyes I can't do both hands maam you can't\\ntext with like your thumbs you only have\\nto text with your index finger I have to\\nrelearn it really I'm old I'm old right\\nbut when did you start texting just with\\none finger God damn it man I've been\\ndoing it forever and Aaron totally makes\\nfun of me for it because it takes me\\nforever and I just tap it out why do you\\ndo that that seems weird if you remember\\nthe time I was on your podcast years ago\\nand didn't know I could put my phone on\\nsilent and I'm pitching CU it\\nI got bummed out when Apple took away\\nthat switch used to be a switch so you\\nknew it was off you knew it was on\\nvibrate I know dude why they take away\\nthat switch I don't know now it's Buton\\nthey replace with a button but the\\nbutton gets pressed accidentally\\nsometimes got it a lot of the times does\\nit hurt does it hurt Jesus Christ that's\\nthe name of the book does it hurt how\\nmany copies let's find out how many\\ncopies of does it hurt have been sold do\\nthey give out that information they have\\nto right New York Times bestseller list\\nand [\\xa0__\\xa0] like I don't know I mean this\\nis in the genre of the um I think we've\\ntalked about it like the Bigfoot porn\\nlike there's a whole series of Bigfoot\\nlike where Bigfoot is just like like\\nstealing like women who've been camping\\ndragging oh yeah bigf porn is come to\\nBigfoot yeah there's come for big come\\nfor bigfoot yeah there's a a whole group\\nof those books and I guess some women\\nget off on the fact of being just\\nSavaged by Bigfoot yeah or Bigfoot\\neating their [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] and like dude\\nimagine the tongue on that guy they love\\nit wonderful God feel like your whole\\nhead and they fall in love with him\\ninevitably I don't blame\\nhim it's a bear it's a [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nsuperdimensional creature you think he's\\nyou believe in that the dimensional\\nBigfoot I think there are states of\\nConsciousness that you can\\nreach whether it's under duress fear\\nanxiety combination of those things\\nthere's py Patric drugs psychedelic\\ndrugs but I think there's a there's a\\nplace that you could reach where you\\ncould see into other possibilities I\\nthink you can see things that aren't\\nnecessarily there in a physical sense\\nbut you can you're there with them\\nthey're there with you right they don't\\nexist but you can see them and it's not\\na hallucination it's like you're tapping\\ninto like the grayness in between\\nuniverses and between Dimensions you're\\ntapping into this area of weirdness yeah\\nand this area of weirdness I think is\\nghosts I think this area of weirdness is\\ngoblins and and things that people see\\nsometimes I don't think they're real I\\ndon't think anybody's going to get eaten\\nby a goblin but I I do think that\\nthere's too many [\\xa0__\\xa0] stories of\\nelves for me not to think that someone\\nreached some State of Mind where they\\nsaw like a little person in the woods\\ntalking to them right and that little\\nperson might be real it just might not\\nbe a physical thing that you could put\\non a scale they call it the realm you\\nthere might be something there yeah I\\nthink there just too many too many\\nstories that the problem of Stories\\nbeing similar is people hear the stories\\nand then they their imagination takes\\nover and they depict their thing similar\\nto the story that they've heard that's a\\nproblem but like a copycat [\\xa0__\\xa0] out\\ncopycat [\\xa0__\\xa0] artist problem but\\nthere's there's also too many stories of\\nelves man yeah there's too many of those\\nstories and there's too many depictions\\nof elves that are dancing around\\nmushrooms like yeah [\\xa0__\\xa0] duh like duh\\nlike maybe they're real like maybe\\nyou're being ignorant and so silly and\\nso cocky especially people that have no\\npsychedelic experience right those\\nbabies yeah those [\\xa0__\\xa0] babies when\\nthey talk to you about the damage it\\ndoes and the danger does while they're\\nfat and out of shape shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up\\nshut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you literally don't\\nknow what you're talking about you have\\nno idea what's possible you're living in\\nthis [\\xa0__\\xa0] black and white TV world\\nand you've been brainwashed I mean don't\\nforget that like they went through the\\nWar on Drugs they got indoctrinated into\\nthis insane anti have to do it if\\nthey're experts in the field whatever\\nthe whatever field is represented you\\nknow like whatever sciences that have to\\ndo with neoch chemistry I got you you\\nmean the fashionable attitude people who\\nare like trying to protect their careers\\nhave to even though even though inside\\nthey know so all of the professors who\\nwe go to as experts are all compromised\\nat least in some way a lot of them I\\nshouldn't say all of them but a lot of\\nthem just by virtue if you stick your\\nneck out and say I like to use silus\\nibin like people go like what well\\nyou're crazy drug addict but dude like\\nyou know like doblin he's having\\nmeetings in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Pentagon I think\\nthe the Consciousness has changed the\\nzeit guys changed and and it has because\\nof the internet because you know you can\\nhear Terence McKenna lectures you can\\nhear Alan Watts you can hear people\\ntalking about it you could you could\\nwatch documentaries on psychedelics you\\ncould see what Maps has done you could\\nsee all the podcasts that dolin's gone\\non I mean how many people are we talking\\nabout that have been exposed to these\\nideas that were never exposed to them\\nwhen we were kids when we were kid when\\nyou and I were kids when we were in high\\nschool you didn't hear [\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nthere's this one dude who was a drug\\naddict and he hung out over there and\\nhe's a loser and you didn't hear a peep\\nabout shamanic rituals and Gordon Watson\\ngoing down to Mexico and getting all the\\nmushrooms and you know and doing these\\nceremonies with these traditional shaman\\ndown you didn't hear any of that you\\ndidn't hear any of it nothing nobody\\nknew what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] was going on with we\\nwere kids they silenced it they threw\\nwater on the\\nbiggest the one of the biggest cultural\\nrevolutions that's documentable without\\nthe use of the internet and that was the\\nPsychedelic revolution of the 1960s it\\nchanged music it changed movies it\\nchanged comedy it changed everything\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] everything every single thing\\ngot changed and in a radical leap if you\\nlook at the 1950s you look at the the\\n1960s like woo something happened look\\nat the cars got cooler the the music\\nsounded better like that's a big\\ncultural shift and you know we have to\\nthan for that the CIA yeah CIA the\\nCIA the CIA is the reason that all these\\nLSD studies happen and like um who wrote\\nOne Flew Over the the Cuckoo's Nest uh\\nKing key yeah King key apparently was in\\none of these uh LSD experiments so like\\nand he's just one of many great artists\\nwho accidentally got like liberated\\nMally by the [\\xa0__\\xa0] CIA and you know\\nwhat I mean they were just like we want\\nto use this to interrogate people and\\nall of a sudden you've got Jimmy\\nHendrick and they're like w we didn't\\nexpect\\nthat oh my God and then there's also so\\nthere's also uh all these theories about\\nthe CIA creating like the whole Laurel\\nCanyon scene the rock and roll scene and\\nit's it's very compelling it's very\\ninteresting it seems like they were\\ninvolved I think they've always been\\ninvolved in the music business just like\\nthey've always been involved in the\\nmovie business like it makes sense the\\nidea that the music business somehow\\nEscape their grasp like shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up\\nshut shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up that's crazy\\nbecause like who you promote that's the\\nperson that becomes famous and we've all\\nseen that with like there's been you\\nknow A Millie vanill and [\\xa0__\\xa0] like that\\nlike it didn't make any sense why why\\nare they promoting this cuz like they\\nthey had a product they're trying to\\npush this product and there's a lot of\\nmoney behind that and also a lot of\\ninfluence cultural influence and when\\nthey went through all that Vietnam [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nwith the [\\xa0__\\xa0] The Beetles and you\\nremember that they were like hey hey hey\\nenough of this Lenin nonsense shut the f\\nall we are saying is give pce a chance\\nshut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up you're making it hard\\nfor us to sell heroin yeah we're over\\nthere scooping up heroin in the South\\nPacific and you're [\\xa0__\\xa0] ruining\\neverything imagine all the people\\nno\\nno like yeah I don't know man like all I\\nknow is like you it's like there it's a\\nvery confusing thing if you want to be\\nhonest if you love\\npsychedelics you owe a thank you to the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nCIA you know what I mean like like\\nbecause I I mean I don't know I don't\\nknow for sure like I don't know for sure\\nif the if the 60s as we understand them\\nwould have happened I don't think the\\nCIA was like hey let's create a lot of\\nflower children and make people like\\nrevalue life and realize that money\\nmaybe isn't actually like something you\\nshould die for and like go against War\\nbut I think like boom wow that that's\\nwhat happened I mean and we got the uni\\nbomber\\n[Laughter]\\ntoo we got a lot of people yeah there's\\na lot of people that came out of that\\nhere's a question what I want you to\\nimagine a world where the uh sweeping\\npsychedelics Act of 1970 never gets\\ninstalled it never happens yeah do you\\nsomehow or another either they just\\ndon't think it's a priority or it's a\\nyou know different Administration\\nthey're not interested in locking down\\ndrugs and yeah because the one of the\\nmotivations for that in the 1970s was\\nthat they were going to Target civil\\nrights activists and anti-war activists\\nthat's what one of the meth methods to\\ndo it is to turn all these drug into\\nthat everybody was using into schedule\\none drugs all these drugs that made\\npeople question Society all these drugs\\nthat made people want to tune in turn on\\ndrop out all those drugs they were like\\nwe got to put a [\\xa0__\\xa0] kabash on all\\nthese culture shifting drugs and the\\nwild thing is they [\\xa0__\\xa0] did it that's\\nthe Wild Thing and that the brainwashing\\nstill works today the brainwashing that\\nthey did yeah on these compounds that\\nmight be the root of all religious\\nexperiences all these things that you're\\nhearing about in the babat G all these\\nthings you're hearing about in the Bible\\nthese wild ass crazy stories like what\\nreally happened those people might have\\nhad a psychedelic experience and in fact\\nthe thing about that the university in\\nJerusalem that attributes the story of\\nMoses and the burning bush to dimethyl\\ntrip toine yeah because they think it\\nmight be AA Bush right and they think\\nthey think were one of these bushes\\nthat's really rich in DMT it makes sense\\nburning bush like you smoke it duh it's\\nright there in front of your face right\\nand if you take that and especially if\\nyou take that 5,000 years ago oh my god\\nof you're going to be convinced you're\\ntalking to God yeah God talked to me it\\nreally did happen brothers and sisters\\nand you tell this story go this is what\\nGod told us this is what we need to do\\nwe need to love each other we need to\\nfollow laws he gave us the laws a series\\nof\\nlaws remember um uh who was it Mel\\nBrooks uh I have brought you these 15\\nand he drops one of them [\\xa0__\\xa0] 10 10\\ncommandments you remember that is\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] hilarious classic That's a\\nclassic H yeah well I mean look for sure\\ndude I mean like the the and these like\\nthe the consumption of these things has\\nup until\\nrecently tended to be underground like\\nif you look at like what's it called Kon\\nif you look at the\\nlike it it has been weirdly an\\nunderground thing and I think that's\\nwhat we that if there is some cool thing\\nthat came from us coming up on the War\\non Drugs yeah is like when I was taking\\nLSD in high\\nschool and getting like an\\nimmediate reality check which is like\\nyou're hearing about this as being like\\nsince you are a kid you're going to go\\nnuts\\nyou're going to like become legally\\ninsane whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that means and\\nthen you take it and you're processing\\nweird [\\xa0__\\xa0] that happened in your\\nchildhood you're loving yourself you're\\nlooking at the world and seeing it like\\nit's the most beautiful thing you've\\never seen you're hearing music that\\nyou've heard a million times for the\\nfirst time and you realize oh they're\\nlying this is wonderful this isn't\\nMadness and if it is madness then this\\nis the kind of crazy all of us need to\\ngo like and and so what but you couldn't\\ntell your parents you wanted to you\\nwanted to be like Mom I I think this\\nmight help you but you couldn't because\\nyou go you'd be [\\xa0__\\xa0] you so fiveyear\\nmandatory minimum 5e [\\xa0__\\xa0] mandatory\\nminimum they're locking people up\\nthere's still people in jail right now\\nfor this [\\xa0__\\xa0] beautiful gift to\\nhumanity and so we got to experience it\\nfrom the underground perspective which\\nwas mostly horrific it produces paranoia\\nyou were scared you felt like a criminal\\nfor nothing so yeah man like the but but\\nif you look at the history any substance\\nlike psilocybe and LSD that breaks down\\nthe identity that allows freedom from\\nthe sense of this is me and that's you\\nand produces at least the potential for\\nmerging uh with reality and with other\\npeople it's not going to work for that\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] hierarchical system for the\\nhierarchical system to function you need\\nyou're below me you're above me and and\\nthe moment you're like we're we're all\\nthe same then suddenly the cast systems\\nstop working classism stops working the\\nwhole [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing falls apart which is\\nwhy I think that book you gave me the\\nsacred Mushroom in the cross or you\\ndidn't give me it when I was living with\\nyou you actually I was a dick I I left\\non the [\\xa0__\\xa0] floor like one of the\\nlike reading materials you gave me\\nduring that wonderful time was this\\ninsane book about how Jesus and\\nChristianity has its roots in psilocybin\\nyeah but like if you just for the sake\\nof this rant if you look at Jesus as\\npsychedelics it makes a lot of sense\\nbecause what Jesus is saying is you\\ndon't need a priest class to communicate\\nwith the Divine you can do it right now\\nanytime you want any day you want it's\\nalways here for you that's exactly what\\nthe mushrooms tell you and and what\\nhappens to Jesus they [\\xa0__\\xa0] kill him\\nand so it's like the the relationship\\nbetween centralized power and\\npsychedelics has always been a\\ncontentious one right because because\\nthe psychedelics just tell you yeah\\nyou're okay that's one of the things\\nthey'll tell you may maybe you need to\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] like walk your dogs more or\\nwhatever but like ultimately you get\\nthis realization I'm okay it's also the\\npower structures that exist without\\npsychedelics aren't possible if\\neveryone's on psychedelics and then you\\nhave ancient Greece right so like how\\ndid ancient Greece emerge and emerged\\nbecause of the kukan it emerged because\\nof the people these doing these ucini\\nMysteries they were they were learning\\nthings about themselves and the world\\nand and they were they decided to like\\nlet's create\\ndemocracy I mean that's really what it\\ncomes from so that's what's scary that's\\nwhat's scary to people that are in power\\nand also the ignorance they they we know\\nthat they haven't done it because if\\nthey've done it they wouldn't be\\nadvocating against it it doesn't make\\nany sense unless they've only done it\\nonce and and they reverted or maybe a\\ncouple times people do revert one of the\\nthings that makes people revert is they\\nget older and they get bitter yeah and\\nthey haven't done psychedelics in a long\\nlong time and then they they become like\\na shitty Republican when they get older\\nyou know well you know man this is this\\nis the this is what I there's this H\\nBuddhist teacher I love Sharon salsburg\\nand one of her say I love is the healing\\nis in the return meaning yeah the way\\nthe way for form works is especially\\nwith psychedelics you get the glimpse of\\nthe Divine you forgive yourself thus\\nforgiving everyone around you you but\\nyou experienced true compassion and then\\nyou come down and then you crust up you\\nknow what I mean you crust the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up\\nand now you get crusty and now you're\\nlike starting to get irritable again and\\nangry again and [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and like yeah\\nand if you don't mitigate that in some\\nway but by like what is\\nit what does it Bill hi say\\nsqueegeeing your [\\xa0__\\xa0] thir yeah yeah\\nif you don't like do a nice squeegee\\nhere and there then yeah you do end up\\ncrusted over you do end up like looking\\nback at those ideas you had and saying\\nto yourself that was highly unrealistic\\nwhat the [\\xa0__\\xa0] was I thinking but you\\nknow there's always that's the thing\\nit's\\nalways I don't this is I this is my\\nproblem with\\npsychedelics my problem with\\npsychedelics is psychedelics can they\\ndon't obviously it's a a chemical but\\nwhat can happen is psychedelics youed\\nbecome the priest class so you take the\\nPsychedelic and you think I'm\\nexperiencing this because of the thing\\nwhen the reality is the thing is showing\\nyou what's in you it's always there\\nright and so the healing is in the\\nreturn is the moment you realize like oh\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] it's still here it never went\\nanywhere right right and so those crusty\\nass [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nRepublicans whoever they may be like\\njust under the [\\xa0__\\xa0] surface is that\\nunitive Consciousness if you ask me yeah\\nthey're just cowards when if if you're\\nthat way if you're authoritarian whether\\nyou're authoritarian left or\\nauthoritarian right generally speaking\\nunless you're talking about crime and\\nlike and even then you're you're scared\\nright because really you should be\\naddressing the root of the problem which\\nis like why why do so many people from\\nso many very distinct areas keep going\\ninto crime and why is there NE nothing\\nbeing done to stop that but those those\\npeople that are authoritarian like in\\nterms of like religious beliefs and in\\nterms of uh Behavior the way people\\ndress gays in public that kind of stuff\\nthose people are all scared that comes\\nfrom a place of being\\nscared gay people in public is not a\\nproblem [\\xa0__\\xa0] in public is a problem\\nand if the gay people are nice you have\\na great time if the gay people are\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] just like if the straight\\npeople are [\\xa0__\\xa0] you have a shitty\\ntime it's not a gay straight thing it's\\na human being being kind and normal and\\nfriendly to people and that's possible\\nwith everybody but people think oh those\\nare the ones that are going to be mean\\nto me and [\\xa0__\\xa0] them and they're\\nresponsible no those are individual\\nhuman beings and you're grouping them\\ntogether because you're scared you can\\ncall it patter recognition you can call\\nit whatever you want you can call it\\nracism we call whatever you want but all\\nyou're doing you're lumping people in\\ntogether because you're scared that's it\\nand you should be aware of danger but to\\nto be so scared that you want to control\\nother people's behavior is like a bad\\nsign that's a bad sign you know if you\\nwant to tell people what language they\\ncan use that's a bad sign that sounds\\nreligious too if you want to tell people\\nhow they have to dress or what kind of\\nmusic they listen to like this has all\\nbeen bad always from the beginning of\\ntime whether it's coming from the left\\nor the right whether it's [\\xa0__\\xa0] the\\nthe Al Gore [\\xa0__\\xa0] that was in the the\\nTipper Gore [\\xa0__\\xa0] in the 1980s that was\\ncoming from the left so left-wing\\npoliticians are trying to censor rap\\nmusic that's the reason why you have\\nthose those dummies they created that\\nwarning explicit lyrics that's all\\nanybody wanted to buy they didn't have\\nthe warning explicit lyrics kids didn't\\neven want to buy those CDs get the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nout of here for your G-rated rap andw\\ndice clayu remember Dice Clay had that\\non his [\\xa0__\\xa0] album what oh score dude\\nwhat boosted album sales I'll tell you\\nthis roof but that was but the point is\\nit's the same thing right it's the same\\non the left as it does on the right it's\\njust authoritarians and they're all\\nscared you got it this is exact this is\\nso your question do I believe in Satan I\\nBelieve In Fear And fear and the devil\\nare the [\\xa0__\\xa0] same thing and it's like\\nthis is if you want to talk about what\\nSatan is it's the it's the cloud of fear\\nthat lives inside the individual and\\nthen collectivize in a fearful reaction\\nand how do frighten people react to\\nthings anger violence judgment you and\\nand and and so like so what's the\\nopposite of fear man love love is the\\nopposite of fear here and so this is to\\nme like this is the issue it's not left\\nright it's it's that if you're making\\ndecisions based on\\nfear more than likely the result is\\ngoing to create something that makes you\\nmore afraid and if you know that's just\\nhow it works it just fear leads to\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] fear it's in the ingredients\\nit's in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] ingredients\\ndude yeah yeah yeah yeah so you just\\nturn on the [\\xa0__\\xa0] light I mean\\nBuddhism this is when they talk about\\nEnlightenment they talk about like in a\\nif you're if you if we're in a pitch\\nblack room it could be scary I don't\\nknow what's around me there's weird\\nsounds what what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you ever woken\\nup in the middle of the night kind of\\nblery and something that's been in your\\nroom forever you can't see it clearly\\nbecause you're waking up and you're like\\nit's a person oh it's my chair\\n[Laughter]\\nright so so the example this and this is\\nwhy\\nSatan in mythology is the deceiver\\nbecause it's not there it's literally\\nnot [\\xa0__\\xa0] there the moment you turn on\\nthe light everything's fine except in\\nthis case the light is love the moment\\nthat\\nyou have the [\\xa0__\\xa0] guts to love the\\nperson that you're like to really like\\ncultivate love [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude no one's scary\\nanymore you're you with my kids you know\\nyou're anyone who has kids knows what\\nI'm [\\xa0__\\xa0] talking about they can do\\nthings that are insane like to your\\nhouse to the walls to they say things to\\nyou that if any adult said it to you you\\nmight never forgive them you're going to\\nthink about it for a long [\\xa0__\\xa0] time\\nlike your beard stinks or whatever you\\nknow what I mean like you meet somebody\\nlike dude your [\\xa0__\\xa0] beard stinks\\nhonestly I probably like like you but\\nyou know what I mean because we love our\\nkids instantly forgiven you don't hold\\ngrudges not just that they're also they\\ndon't know any better haven't learned\\nsocial skills ah and this is why one of\\nmy favorite things Jesus said when he's\\nbeing crucified father forgive them they\\ndon't know what they're doing and that's\\nwhat he [\\xa0__\\xa0] meant how much of that\\ndo you think is historically accurate\\nlike how much of the Jesus story do you\\nthink is historically accurate when you\\nhear about it no idea don't care yeah I\\ndon't care I I just love the story I\\ndon't care I I love the story and I love\\nI love a story about what happened\\nbecause you always have to filter\\nthrough the very real understanding that\\nwe all have about the way human beings\\ntell stories it's hard to know what's\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] because people just lie about\\nstuff and that's not a new thing yeah so\\nbut people also tell the truth about\\nstuff that's not a new thing either\\npeople also write down very important\\nthings and there are people that are\\nvirtuous and there are people that are\\nhonest and there there are people that\\nare authentic they've always existed\\nright and they've always there's people\\nthat are smart enough to understand the\\nvalue of just being truthful right so\\nthose people that encountered something\\nexceptional and crazy something insane\\nwhether it is uh you know the\\nresurrection or whatever it was like\\nyeah I would like I would love to know\\nwhat the [\\xa0__\\xa0] they really said like what\\nwhat were the actual words why did you\\nwrite it down what did what really\\nhappened how many people were told this\\nstory back and forth over hundreds of\\nyears before you wrote it down yeah what\\nwas the original story\\nlike we don't it's so hard it's like\\ntrying to get a story about the things\\nthat George Washington said that weren't\\nwritten down yeah they weren't written\\ndown you know like right 300 years ago\\nwhat how well you like so in the same\\nway fear produces other forms of writing\\nlike mind comp you know what I me so\\nlike it's simatics you know you take a\\nvibration you throw some [\\xa0__\\xa0] flower\\non a vibrating plate according to the\\nlike whatever the frequency is it forms\\na certain it creates a pattern right so\\nlike fear fear always creates a pretty\\nsimilar pattern right and love also\\ncreates a very similar pattern so so\\nlike this the Book of John my favorite\\nbook in the Gospels it starts off with\\nin the beginning was the word but and\\nthe word became a person and so but\\nthat's not really what it's saying it's\\nlike it's logos so in the there in the\\nbeginning was some fun fundamental\\nreality just truth just basic beautiful\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] perfect truth and that's what\\nthe universe sprang from and then that\\ntruth became a person so the truth could\\nnow talk it like it now began to convey\\nitself to other people and so that TR\\nthat truth I think if you understood it\\nenough you could probably create a set\\nof symbols that would function on many\\nlevels that were all good one level just\\nbasic ethics do unto others what you\\nwould have them do unto you blessed are\\nthe peacemakers all of this stuff right\\nbut then knowing human psyche and and\\nthe human mind you could\\nalso hide deeper levels of that truth\\ninto Parables into like stories that are\\nmathematically perfect to the point\\nwhere the crucifixion if you look at it\\nfrom the perspective of two intersecting\\ntimelines which is the infinite and the\\nfinite meeting which is what humans are\\nthen you realize we're all being\\ncrucified on time and there and then the\\ncrucifixion becomes like a existential\\nreality this is what you want to know\\nwhy you're feeling [\\xa0__\\xa0] up it's\\nbecause part of you is forever and part\\nof you is going to die and you are\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] hanging on a cross between two\\nthieves the past and the [\\xa0__\\xa0] future\\nand anytime you're thinking about that\\nit's stealing the moment and so like you\\nthen there's that level right and so any\\nof these great texts like the New\\nTestament\\nthey're coded so that depending on where\\nyou want to go with it you can go as\\ndeep as you want it's an infinite rabbit\\nhole and I think that rabbit hole\\nemerged from vibration I sound like\\nwhat's his face the guy I loved him I'm\\nthe\\nTerren Terence Howard like idiot\\nTerrence Howard but like like uh I sound\\nlike dumb Terence I I I know he was\\ntalking about vibrations and stuff he's\\ngreat but like my point\\nis\\nif there is some fundamental VI\\nvibration to love then that\\nmight grow into time in a story and the\\nstory because it's coming from perfect\\ntruth would have infinite levels to it\\nthat it was alive the story itself would\\nbe alive which is why they call the\\nBible like the Living Word it's alive\\nit's talking to you it's not a one-way\\ncommunication it's like that's what's\\nscary about it dude read the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nBible on\\nmus you know what I mean like that's\\nprobably How It Was Written what I wish\\nI could read like the ancient versions\\nin the language and understand the\\nlanguage and the context me too because\\nit's not just about learning the\\nlanguage it would be about understanding\\nthe context of the language like imagine\\nif you could really understand ancient\\nHebrew where letters double as numbers\\ndude like that must be so weird yeah man\\nand like that's real that's the other\\nthing about it is like the historic\\nJesus and all that God that that [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nlike like like okay I don't know but\\nlook at the thing itself right look at\\nwhat look what it said look what\\nwhatever this idea spawned look what it\\nlook what it means like look at all the\\nthe powerful principles that are that\\nemerge from it and then I'll look at\\nlike the moral scaffolding that it\\nprovides for people yeah and and then\\nand then and then like like I think the\\nreason like people get creeped out by it\\nis because\\nwhere there's one thing its opposite\\nmust appear right so here's this thing\\ninvite that that is dissolving power\\nstructures and and dissolving the priest\\nclass and dissolving like all of it and\\nthen you look at like the modern-day\\nversions of it and you see the same\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] hierarchy you see this thing\\nthat it seems to be antithetical too\\nwhich is like saying like this is\\nbetween you and me like suddenly there's\\npeople tell telling you you're wrong\\ninterpreting it for you and you look at\\nthat and you're like [\\xa0__\\xa0] that [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nwhatever that is I'm not in and it's\\ncharismatic people in front of large\\ngroups of people that really know how to\\nmanipulate people with the way they talk\\nyeah I mean this is the thing that was\\nso uh problematic when they first\\nstarted translating the Bible into\\nphonetic languages into to languages\\nlike German when people started like\\nduring the Martin Luther days they're\\nlike hey what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are you doing it\\nused to be the priests how to read the\\nBible cuz they could read it in Latin\\nyou don't know Latin so shut the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up\\nthis is what God wants you to do do it\\nand then Martin Luther's coming along\\nand said you should interpret this your\\nown way yeah and it's just like what so\\nthey taken away The Gatekeepers to God\\nthat's it but when you have it's so\\ncrazy that it's such an efficient\\nbusiness they still run these [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nfranchises even though the book is\\navailable everywhere it's so crazy that\\nlike this one person interprets this\\nbetter than everybody else so you go and\\nsee him and he talks and then they\\ndevelop Egos and they have Jets and they\\nhave [\\xa0__\\xa0] mansions Rolls-Royce it's\\nso crazy that that works crazy that that\\nworks when that book is available for\\neverybody and should be interpreted I\\nmean you should understand what it means\\nyou shouldn't interpret it ignorantly\\nright right but you if you're if you're\\nwise enough to be able to encapture what\\nthey're trying to say just capture in\\nyour mind what they're trying to say and\\ntranslate it into a thing that makes\\nsense like what were they talking about\\nyeah what happened is this is this a map\\nof how the universe was created in the\\nbeginning there was light is that a map\\nor is that life itself like what is that\\nwhat is it and what is that and and to\\nto me that's like all like the Bava any\\nof these beautiful texts that's what's\\nfun about them is that they it's\\nproducing a kind of like bizarre riddle\\nin your own mind as you're trying to\\ndecode it but then there's a pull the\\nmore you study it the more more you get\\ndrawn in and the more and when you start\\ngetting really drawn in that's when\\npeople start appearing around you that\\nhelp in non a non- nefarious way that\\nlike you just start meeting people who\\nhelp you understand it a little bit more\\nand that's where it gets [\\xa0__\\xa0] weird\\nsimul yes dude you're like Sim the\\nsimulation is [\\xa0__\\xa0] real and by the\\nway now that we've talked about the\\nBible can I talk about my new favorite\\nbook yes dianic\\nhave you heard of this book yes um I\\nheard if you're really good at it they\\nput you on a boat an org and an or you\\nyou get be a part of an org a sea org a\\nsea or and you get a jacket with like\\nsome metals [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude it's uh my I've\\nsaid on this podcast a million times my\\nfavorite Mark Twain quote religion is\\nwhat happened when the first con man met\\nthe first\\nfool and dude like that's the problem\\nwith all this stuff is like this is the\\nproblem is there's too many versions\\nright so someone's wrong no the problem\\nis people don't trust their [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\ninstincts and it's like drive all blames\\ninto oneself it's like I'm like this is\\nyour nothing that I am seen in the New\\nTestament seems to be inviting you to\\nthrow your rational mind away it it's\\nthe the whole [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing is crazy\\nit's crazy but it's like the invitation\\nis to like you God gave you a rational\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] mind if there is a God and and\\nlike anyone telling you to discard that\\nand and and and forgo your\\ninterpretation for theirs yeah dude\\nwatch the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out this is your job like\\njust like whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing is\\nwhether it's the Bible rdit conspiracy\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] forchan whatever the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nthing is what are you afraid of like how\\ndo you not trust your mind how weak are\\nyou are you really afraid to like take\\ndata in do you think you're like you're\\ngoing to be corrupted by data well isn't\\nit also an identity thing because if you\\nidentify as the person that gets a talk\\nin front of everybody you're the priest\\nright that's your identity and you're\\nnot going to give that up because then\\nyou're just another person who reads the\\nBible yeah well then Mike can go up too\\ntomorrow Mike's goingon to go up Mike's\\nbeen trying at home practicing in front\\nof the mirror and he thinks he's ready\\nto priest to be a priest so why don't\\nyou let Mike try it tomorrow night and\\nthen Debbie's been reading a lot too and\\nDeb like to try Tuesday this guy's used\\nto getting his jollies off three four\\ntimes a week telling people about blast\\nfor me yeah yeah and then especially if\\nyou're like one of them Tent Revival\\nguys those wild dudes like Kennison used\\nto be yeah just con artist Carn artists\\nthat are also saying biblical quotes but\\nthey're manipulating people they're\\nthey're they're really good at talking\\nthey're Hypno hypnotizing people with\\ntheir words just like you hypnotize a\\ncomedy audience dude this is why I\\nlisten to Christian radio man because\\nlike why don't you look no it's a comic\\nlistening to sermons and recognizing\\nlike that's a joke like that's a he's\\ndone that a lot like that's one of his\\ngags like I know that's a bit I know\\nwhat that is that's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] but you\\nknow again it's like the comment section\\nthis is not an example of humanity it's\\nan example of [\\xa0__\\xa0] people with\\ntoxoplasmosis who are you know what you\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] you know but isn't it also\\njust an example\\nof you to to you're not going to have\\neveryone be the same you're going to\\nhave people that they never learned\\nthings well like look look if you if I\\ngot hired uh to be a part of some\\nmathematical study yeah I'm not I'm\\nuseless okay I'm not that guy right\\nthat's I [\\xa0__\\xa0] up that part of my life\\nI never really learned that didn't pay\\nattention I'm not interested so that's\\nnot me but someone out there is right\\nand you to have those two things exist\\nsimultaneously you're going to have to\\nhave an infinite variety of\\npossibilities for human beings so that's\\npart of the problem part of the problem\\nis some people are just out of their\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] minds and if those people out of\\ntheir [\\xa0__\\xa0] minds get special rights\\nlike the tax-free exempt status because\\nthey're a pastor and they're a [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\npsychopath who just really good at\\nconning people and they're running this\\norganization there might be a guy right\\ndown the street that's a real Christian\\nthere might be a guy right down the\\nstreet that's a really kind person who's\\nreally reading the the word of Christ\\nand he does it not for profit he does it\\nto try to like establish the the love of\\nGod in his community and he takes these\\npeople in like their family there's this\\nbeautiful Community aspect to it where\\neverybody's like kind to each other\\nthere beautiful things to church right\\nthat's true too but the problem as\\nhumans just like the problem with our\\nability to other each other just like\\nour problem with the ability to attack\\npeople on the other side of the\\npolitical Spectrum who live in the same\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] city as you yeah like people are\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] r against other people in their\\ntown that want to vote for this guy that\\nwants to do this and this guy wants to\\ndo that and [\\xa0__\\xa0] you you commi and\\neveryone's going crazy dude I know it's\\njust a human thing it's a tribal thing\\nwe are not yet cooked we're we are a\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] softboiled Egg Baby and we're we\\nare runny where's some eggs you get at\\nthe diner you go oh you see that [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nGill that's us that's us we're not all\\nthe way cooked yeah and when you eat\\nthings that aren't all the way cooked\\nyou a lot of [\\xa0__\\xa0] problems you're\\ngoing to get sick yeah but we're getting\\ncooked buddy we're getting microwaved\\nwe're going to get AI microwaved in\\nabout 3 years that's right baby the\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] AI Messiah is coming baby we are\\ngoing to do a podcast you and I before\\nthis thing is done before civilization\\nslides into the ocean again we're we're\\nyou and I are going to do a podcast\\nwhere we communicate with everyone with\\nno words I know it's going to happen\\nyou're going to do it I'm going to do it\\nwe're going to be talking to each other\\nwith no words and we're talking to\\neveryone one else out there with no\\nwords too we're all going to be synced\\nup it's just going to be a sea of ideas\\nexposing each other to other ideas and\\nlike considering other ideas with no\\nattachment at all to your ego it's going\\nto be super weird and then you know\\nwhat's going to happen aliens land no\\nwe're going to look around and be like\\nwait this this doesn't look like the\\nRogan Studio this is just like some\\nweird [\\xa0__\\xa0] room and then a CIA agent\\nis going to come in and be like thank\\nyou so much for participating in the\\nexperiment and Trump will be on his\\nfourth turn no it'll be the 60s and\\nwe'll realize we're we in a [\\xa0__\\xa0] MK\\nUltra experiment that's probably true\\nwe've been rambling at each other for\\nlike what feels like a long time like\\nour whole lifetimes but it was like 5\\nSeconds like well okay thank you for\\ntrying out 79 BLX y really appreciate\\nbasement in Harvard right now yeah\\nhere's 20 bucks see right and jolly West\\nis looking at us with a\\nclipboard d I love you to death you're\\nthe [\\xa0__\\xa0] man always
